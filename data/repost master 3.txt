02:27 
Yeah. 

02:27 
Yeah. 

02:27

02:27 
and that's it. So it's pretty much the same thing. Like I said, this stuff is pretty simple. 

02:38 
And for right here, how to easily add more Facebook pages. I'm not going to read this 

02:43 
whole thing, but if you guys need to look through this again, you guys can read through 

02:49 
this and follow it step by step. I'll show you guys how to do it. Let me share my thing 

02:56 
again. So here you want to go under your main Facebook profile. So the thing with 

03:10 
Facebook is you have a main Facebook profile and you can add a bunch of, a Facebook profile 

03:19 
is different from a Facebook page. So you can add a bunch of Facebook pages under 

03:25 
your main facebook profile that way you don't have to be creating new emails and all that 

03:30 
and then once if you're once you're done working for a client if he wants to keep the facebook 

03:36 
page you can add a password or just share access to him and he'll remove your access and he'll be 

03:42 
able to keep the facebook page but from here i'm on as you guys can see i'm on my main facebook 

03:48 
page what you want to do is you see on the on the top left it says pages 

03:53 
pages you want to put create at the top left create and then from right here just 

04:05 
follow instructions you know i'm saying it's pretty simple you know how to follow instructions 

04:10 
and you're good and it's pretty simple for that 

04:18 
and then uh for instagram profiles 

04:48 
again i'm not gonna read all this shit you guys need to if you guys need to refer back to this 

04:55 
you guys can pause it and uh follow the step by step right here but i'll show you guys how to do 

05:01 
it just so you guys can get a visual so i'm gonna go ahead and share 

05:05 
share my screen again 

05:18 
give me one sec 

05:21 
so the same thing you know i'm saying um facebook owns instagram so it's the same exact thing you 

05:32 
on the bottom right you see your your profile picture you hold and click that 

05:38 
put add instagram account and you see at the bottom it says create new account 

05:45 
and it'll lead you to the page that you want to follow and then you're good to go 

05:48 
the process of creating a new page same thing 

05:51 
so yeah it's the same thing you can have a bunch of instagram accounts under one main 

06:03 
instagram account center so that way you don't have to be creating new uh 

06:08 
new emails and all that shit so it makes it pretty simple same thing if you stop working 

06:15 
working 

06:16 
working 

06:18 
with someone and they want to keep the instagram account you can add a password and email and you 

06:26 
just send them the details you send them the login info and you're straight that's it and then you 

06:31 
can remove the profile from your device and they'll be able to log in on their phone and it's 

06:36 
pretty simple if you need help with that you could just youtube it um there's you'll be able to find 

06:43 
the video it's pretty easy like i said and then uh go to 14 tips to save time so the only places 

06:53 
you can really save time when posting is instagram and facebook because those are the only 

07:01 
only ones that i've seen that allow you to have drafts in your drafts so like instagram and 

07:07 
tick-tock allow you to keep drafts like i said if you have multiple posts to do that day so download 

07:12 
the videos 

07:13 
in advance and have the posts ready in your drafts so when it comes time to post all you 

07:20 
have to do is hit post and not have to go through the whole downloading and going through the making 

07:24 
the post process each time you know what i'm saying so just download the videos make the post 

07:31 
save it as draft if you have three posts to do um make those three posts and save them as drafts 

07:37 
and then you want to wait at least one hour in between post that way um 

07:44 
the algorithm so that way you allow the algorithm to push that video 

07:49 
you know what i'm saying you don't want to post all three videos at the same time 

07:52 
i've found that when you do that the views get low that's just it's not for sure but every time i
