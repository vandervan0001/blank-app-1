how to do research two things you need to research your customer and your client 

00:04 
how to research your customer another way to refer to them is your ideal viewer target 

00:08 
viewer target audience who's gonna be watching your content what do they like what don't they 

00:11 
like what do or don't they want what makes them happy angry emotional 

00:15 
What entertains them? You essentially have to become them. Really put yourself in their shoes. 

00:19 
How do I research them? Amazon reviews. Look up reviews of your product on Amazon, as well as products similar to the one you're sending. 

00:25 
Reddit. Look up threads, stories, any world content, really. How do I find them on Reddit? 

00:29 
Simply search out what you're selling. If you're selling a testosterone-boosting product, search up topics related to that, like the gym, bodybuilding, etc. 

00:34 
TikTok. This could be the videos they make, comments they leave, their reposted videos, but how do I find their TikTok account? 

00:39 
You can do something called the Burner Map. 

00:41 
What is the Burner Map? It's where you hack your 4U page on TikTok to show you certain videos. 

00:45 
The first step is you have to make a brand new TikTok. 

00:47 
The second step is to scroll through your TikTok 4U feed and only interact with content in the niche of the product you're selling, or in this case, the customer you're researching. 

00:54 
To continue with the previous example, if you're researching people who would likely be interested in your testosterone-boosting product, 

00:59 
make sure you scroll through your 4U page and only engage with videos in that niche. 

01:03 
After a while, TikTok's algorithm will pick up on this and only start to show you content in that niche. 

01:07 
Now, you'll have the content and account of your target audience being attempted, fed to you by TikTok. 

01:11 
As you scroll, make a customer profile. 

01:15 
As you do all these research methods, hit down notes and come up with your ideal customer profile. 

01:19 
This step is optional. If you choose to do it, feel free to be as in-depth or basic with it as you please. 

01:23 
I tend to keep it pretty basic myself with just a few bullet points and that's it. 

01:27 
You really want to embody them all. You really just want to understand who they are. 

01:29 
If you can do this without writing down a customer profile, by all means, go for it. 

01:32 
Plus, if you're having even a little information on a standby, easily accessible, you'll never really regret it. 

01:35 
Like, don't think, you know, what do you think they're interested in? 

01:37 
Their speech patterns, that's important. 

01:38 
When you're really putting yourself in their shoes, 

01:39 
you not only want to say something they'd be interested in, 

01:42 
you want to say it like they'd say it. 

01:43 
You have to learn their slang, learn their speech patterns, learn everything. 

01:46 
Please do not get too caught up in this stuff. 

01:48 
If everything I just said, y'all, please don't get too caught up. 

01:49 
It's very easy to fall in the trap of research 

01:51 
and spend all your time researching and not actually creating the content. 

01:54 
And the content is what makes you the money. 

01:57 
Don't spend weeks researching your target company. 

01:59 
Now, how to research your content. 

02:02 
Save content as you go. 

02:04 
Take info from other niches. 

02:05 
Take info from everything. 

02:08 
You know exactly how I explained above. 

02:09 
Make a new TikTok and only interact with content you want to see. 

02:11 
Don't forget to interact with videos of people selling your product as well. 

02:14 
To continue the testosterone product example, 

02:16 
you want to make sure you interact with all types of content in this niche, 

02:18 
whether it's selling a product or not. 

02:19 
This can save you time because now you will only need to make one new account 

02:22 
to do your customer and product research. 

02:24 
So for the testosterone angle, 

02:25 
you can interact with videos about people selling testosterone boosting supplements 

02:27 
as well as videos people just make about the gym. 

02:29 
You don't have to be doing a... 

02:30 
Just a talking head video about the gym, 

02:39 
with the content you're researching 

02:42 
FYI, these accounts can be started recently. 

02:43 
You do not need to buy an account to do it. 

02:45 
The account you make for the burner message should be used solely for research purposes. 

02:48 
If you are not researching, aka scrolling through your 4U page, you should not even be logged into the account. 

02:52 
Also, if you're doing the SIM message, just make sure as you do for all the accounts that you make, 

02:55 
the SIM message is activated and everything is good because you want to be working for the United States or the United States. 

02:58 
One more thing as well, if you scroll to the bottom of the page off the back of what you're interested in, 

03:03 
If you're scrolling for a bit and you can't seem to find any videos on your 4U page pop up about testosterone-boosting supplements 

03:07 
or the gym or working out or anything like that, feel free to go to the search bar and just type in, like, 

03:10 
gym, testosterone booster, working out, and then just engage with a bit of that content there 

03:13 
so that TikTok sees you have interest in that. 

03:15 
And then go back to your 4U page, scroll, and you very likely should be seeing some videos in the niche. 

03:19 
underneath. 

03:19 
If not, just repeat that step one or two more times, and by that point, you'll definitely have some being fed to you by TikTok. 

03:22 
And then do, as I explained above, just like, engage, comment, share, follow the creator, whatever. 

03:27 
Keep scrolling, and sooner or later, your feed will only be the style of content you're looking for. 

03:30 
Consciously consume. Consciously consuming is when you scroll and pick up, and as you watch videos, you don't just sit there mindlessly. 

03:35 
Instead, as you watch them, you study them. 

03:37 
You want to look for similarities within videos. 

03:39 
What similarities do you see in all of them? 

03:42 
Look at things like the clips, the text, captions, sounds, everything. 

03:45 
It's recommended to have a pen and paper nearby or a Google Doc open to take notes. 

03:48 
You don't need to do this for hours on end either. 

03:49 
If you can do it for 20 minutes a day, every day, you will get a lot better at making videos or content overall a lot faster. 

03:56 
Save content as you go. 

03:57 
Save the content you see and like and then follow it in the app. 

04:01 
I will link a YouTube video going through a quick tutorial below this slideshow or this presentation. 

04:05 
Then name the folders and things like, you know, slideshows, TikTok shop videos, call and play, et cetera. 

04:09 
This can help you organize the content, you save, and easily add it to the radar. 

04:12 
Now when you come to the app and actually create the example, you will have more than enough example videos to look at and begin to recreate and take inspiration from. 

04:18 
Take info from other niches. 

04:19 
If you see content you're following in a different niche, bring it over to yours. 

04:21 
For example, say you see a viral video for dog owners that says, top three mistakes all newbie dog owners make. 

04:26 
And then it goes into and breaks down the top three mistakes. 

04:28 
What you can then do is bring that same video over to another niche you're rating. 

04:32 
Say you're selling a testosterone booster program and you can have it available to help you make it. 

04:34 
You can change up that dog hook to become the top three mistakes all newbie gym owners make. 

04:41 
Then as you talk about the three mistakes, one of them can be not taking a testosterone booster. 

04:43 
This can give you a great opening to plug your balance. 

04:46 
Some more examples. 

04:48 
Take, here's why you're never able to get your homework done on time. 

04:51 
You can polish through this and transform that into, here's why you're never able to achieve your goal in the gym. 

04:56 
See how you brought that over to the testosterone niche and that opened you up to a very easy product line? 

05:00 
Say you see a slideshow ranking someone's top five favorite colognes that went viral. 

05:02 
You can then transform that into ranking your top five favorite supplements as a gym member. 

05:06 
So he saw it. 

05:06 
Say you saw it in that niche, you went viral in that niche, and you brought it over to yours. 

05:09 
Keep in mind, these are just examples as well. 

05:11 
I'm not going to say go ahead. 

05:11 
I'm not going to say go ahead and copy these hooks in your content. 

05:13 
I'm not going to say don't do it. 

05:14 
But these are just examples of showing how you can see something working in one niche and bring it over. 

05:16 
So you have to find the things that are working in the other niche and bring it over to yours. 

05:19 
For these, you may have to flex those creative muscles a lot. 

05:23 
Roughly 80% of the time, you want all your content to be modeled after these images. 

05:27 
Previous viral content you made for the product you're selling, you made for the product you're selling. 

05:30 
Previous viral content other people made for the product you're selling. 

05:32 
Previous viral content made for silver products. 

05:34 
Previous viral content means or means. 

05:36 
The other 20% of the time, it can be some new ideas you made in the past, or even some new ideas you made in the past. 

05:41 
Don't overthink it. 

05:43 
Don't stress about it. 

05:44 
Just control the input, and the results will follow. 

05:46 
Take notes on everything in here. 

05:47 
Do the research, and make the changes. 

05:48 
You will see success quicker if you make content daily and honestly try to improve. 

05:53 
Yes, make your videos with care and effort, but don't be a perfectionist. 

05:56 
And that is all. Thank you for watching. 

06:01 
Thank you for watching. 

06:08 
Thank you.

Table of Contents. Section 1, Intro to Talking Head. Section 2, Breakdown of Talking Head. Section 3, Adam Madden. 

06:21 
talking head section one intro to talking head and how to make it talking head is merely slang 

06:28 
for exactly what it sounds like content where you are talking and you show your face what you talk 

06:34 
about can be anything really so long as it is entertaining and sells the product it's recommended 

06:39 
to show your face in videos because that will add track but i have seen success from people who have 

06:45 
not but honestly saying that out loud now i'm gonna change up that and pretty much i'm gonna 

06:50 
say in every video you make you should be showing your face there's maybe like 0.5 percent of the 

06:57 
time there's a good reason why you don't have to but just just always show your face face in the 

07:02 
video i promise you it's worth it how you make the best content always show your face the videos can 

07:08 
be any duration just make sure you don't yet ideally don't have them going for more than two 

07:13 
minutes though even that's a bit film all videos vertically not like you're filming a youtube video 

07:20 
on-screen text will almost always help and never hold the video and i'm referring to closed captions 

07:26 
specifically step two or not step two section two breakdown of talking head the main point of making 

07:36 
viral videos are the hook the body or story the cta and the sound and caption let's break each 

07:43 
one down the hook there are two parts to the hook the visual and audio for the visual some good 

07:50 
practices are to have some quick initial movement for the first 0.5 seconds have good lighting show 

07:58 
something visually intriguing
