00:05 
So I'm going to be covering copywriting and customer psychology. 

00:08 
If you just want to write scripts and copy viral videos, 

00:10 
just check out the cable data tutorial, and that should do you pretty well. 

00:14 
the best creators I've found are the best copywriters by far, 

00:16 
and they understand customer psychology at a fundamental level. 

00:18 
So we're going to start all the way down deep. 

00:19 
It might not make any sense, but we'll layer it up, 

00:21 
and then by the end of it, it should all get into a specific framework 

00:23 
that you can use to repeatedly make winning scripts and get millions of views, 

00:25 
and most importantly, drive actual sales and get dollars. 

00:27 
So first, understanding psychology at a base level. 

00:29 
People are driven by a few base desires. 

00:32 
This is important because a lot of people talk about copywriting tactics 

00:34 
and frameworks and whatever, but if you don't understand fundamentally 

00:35 
what drives human beings based on evolution over thousands of years, 

00:40 
but these are always going to be the same. 

00:41 
And the five main ones I think are the most applicable of many 

00:43 
are fear, greed, sex, status, and love community. 

00:45 
So with fear, this is pretty easy to see, 

00:47 
especially for older people who want to keep their family safe. 

00:50 
And for younger people, it might be being scared of starting, 

00:52 
being scared of losing things, whatever else. 

00:53 
If you have a relationship, you're scared of losing your girlfriend. 

00:55 
If you have a parent, you're scared of losing your child. 

00:58 
Even any person, going back to a fundamental tribe, 

01:00 
it's like you're scared of losing resources. 

01:01 
So whether that's money, children, family, food, 

01:04 
And this is going to apply to the actual product. 

01:06 
So greed is on the other side of that, 

01:07 
where people want to make or save more money 

01:09 
And you can start to see how that can apply 

01:12 
Sex sells, where we put on this earth to reproduce 

01:14 
as all animals are. 

01:16 
Status, this one's interesting because that's a lot 

01:17 
of different ways that can be interpreted. 

01:19 
For instance, beauty, looks, luxury, fashion, fame, fortune. 

01:21 
But it's not just celebrity and money, 

01:23 
It's like, oh, I want to be famous and I want to be rich. 

01:26 
But more fundamentally, it's like, what is status 

01:29 
and you get compliments, you now increase your status. 

01:30 
If you look more attractive, like the looks maxers, 

01:31 
that's become so big because that's a higher status. 

01:33 
Now you get more Instagram likes, more followers, 

01:34 
more girls are looking at you, more guys are saying, 

01:36 
oh, you look great, right? 

01:37 
It's the admiration of other people. 

01:39 
Humans are organized into a hierarchy, 

01:41 
and this is where you kind of get the meme 

01:42 
of the alpha male or the group leader, 

01:44 
That is the status, which is based on a variety of things. 

01:46 
In your friend group, you might know some person 

01:47 
who's the glue that ties everyone together, 

01:54 
charisma, it might be from a bunch of other things. 

01:56 
The last one is love and community. 

01:58 
Ultimately, being part of a tribe, 

02:00 
because humans were tribal back in the day, 

02:03 
you were outside, and then you're gonna die. 

02:05 
if I want to not die, which is the primary thing, 

02:07 
so then you can reproduce, you need to stay part of the tribe 

02:10 
And then a little bit higher than just being part of the tribe 

02:11 
is also being appreciated, being loved, 

02:13 
surrounded by people that are similar to you. 

02:16 
Now, these desires are the underpinning 

02:18 
So they go all the way back to the caveman era, 

02:20 
And you can tap into these to market products 

02:22 
because people will justify things with logic 

02:27 
If you think anyone's paying $300,000 for a Ferrari 

02:29 
because of the safety features, you're out of your mind. 

02:31 
It's because they want the feeling 

02:32 
of people looking and turning heads 

02:34 
and then, oh, they might get more girls 

02:36 
they might post on Instagram to get some clout. 

02:37 
It's all about status, the hierarchy of luxury goods. 

02:41 
oh, I really worked really hard to deserve it, 

02:43 
They're going to give themselves a justification 

02:44 
because they don't want to internalize these five things. 

02:47 
but they're not what people will intrinsically tell themselves. 

02:49 
They're kind of going to be an underlying emotion 

02:50 
because you don't want to say, 

02:53 
or, oh, I wanted the admiration of other people, 

02:55 
So you can justify with a logical reason 

03:00 
it's a base desire that was driving 

03:02 
Now, why do people buy beyond the base desires? 

03:04 
They want to buy products that solve their problems 

03:06 
and those problems, again, are logically justified 

03:08 
but underpinned with the caveman desire. 

03:09 
So if we can tap into those desires, 

03:10 
we can then sell more products to more people 

03:12 
and ultimately make more money at the end of the day. 

03:14 
So how do we tap into those desires 

03:15 
with direct response marketing? 

03:16 
Now, if you were looking at marketing 

03:18 
and you've seen brand advertising 

03:19 
like a Puma, a Adidas, a Nike, an Apple commercial 

03:21 
where they're just showing off the product. 

03:26 
Now, for Apple, that's going to be very profitable for them. 

03:29 
that is backed by billions of dollars 

03:31 
knows what an iPhone is. 

03:33 
They might even have an iPhone in their hand. 

03:34 
As a result, they don't need to go even deeper 

03:36 
and be more aggressive with their advertising. 

03:38 
Coke can really just show a person smiling 

03:39 
and holding up a can of Coke and drinking it 

03:40 
because almost every person on Earth has tried a Coke. 

03:42 
Now, if you are advertising to people 

03:47 
So if you're looking at any of these brand advertisements 

03:48 
like Luna Glow, Lululemon, whatever, 

03:52 
If you try to do that on TikTok shop 

03:53 
and you're like, hey, here's some sweatpants, 

03:57 
to overcome the fact that nobody's ever heard 

04:04 
Now, direct response is in the name. 

04:06 
You want a response to the advertising 

04:08 
We're not trying to here just get impressions 

04:09 
and get eyeballs and just get views. 

04:13 
So we have to give them a reason to buy, 

04:15 
which will ultimately cause them to incite change 

04:17 
Now, this could just be a like, comment, share, 

04:19 
like we'll talk about in call to action, 

04:22 
So how do you get a person from the journey 

04:33 
Now, the best type of ads are good content, right? 

04:36 
here's the product, it's 50% off, buy it. 

04:39 
and it's really good content that's viral, 

04:41 
and then you also use these principles 

04:46 
we want them to watch the video and then buy. 

04:48 
and don't buy, they're not going to see you. 

04:52 
You can't even find a single video. 

04:57 
So we need them to see the video, 

04:58 
and within those 30 seconds to 60 seconds that you have, 

05:00 
and go from knowing nothing about the product or problem 

05:02 
to then wanting to buy the product and then purchasing it. 

05:05 
and pay $30 and they've never heard of anything, right? 

05:07 
So these are the seven main persuasion tactics 

05:09 
that can get people to take action. 

05:11 
And each one of them on their own is important, 

05:15 
So these are from the book Persuasion by Robert Kildini. 

05:17 
So if you want it more in-depth, you can read that book. 

05:19 
But the synopsis of that book I'll give to you right now 

05:21 
in like the next two minutes from like 200-page book, 

05:22 
the seven main things start with urgency. 

05:25 
As an example, like the deal ends soon, 

05:26 
therefore you get yours now. 

05:27 
So like you have a flash sale on TikTok shop, 

05:28 
it's only 24 hours before the deal ends, 

05:31 
And what base desire this taps into 

05:32 
is the fear of missing out, the greed, right? 

05:33 
I want to save money, I want to get this deal before it, 

05:35 
anyone else can get it before it runs out, right? 

05:36 
And there's also the fear that the deal's going to end. 

05:38 
Even though they've never heard of this deal before, 

05:44 
Because people are much more scared of losing something, 

05:47 
than they are greedy to get something 

05:51 
So urgency is time-based, scarcity is quantity-based. 

05:53 
So quantity, as in like they're able to run out of units. 

05:55 
you have to get this product because they always sell out, 

06:06 
Conspiracy, commitment, and consistency 

06:08 
rather than making people feel like they're going to lose something 

06:10 
It's more that you're giving people something 

06:15 
oh, it comes with all these free things 

06:16 
that I'm giving you all these benefits. 

06:18 
And as a result, you want to give something back, 

06:20 
Again, this is kind of a subconscious thing. 

06:21 
Nobody's thinking, oh, I have a free gift, 

06:25 
that causes them to take action more 

06:27 
The other side of this is commitment. 

06:29 
they're more likely to make another commitment later. 

06:31 
This can be useful if you have a multi-step sales process. 

06:36 
and you can use this in your scripts 

06:37 
if you want to be internally consistent 

06:41 
You could say, as a father myself, 

06:44 
I'm always scared of my kids getting kidnapped or something. 

06:46 
So I'm always vigilant, 

06:48 
That's why I bought this anti-kidnapping kit. 

06:52 
is that if you're talking to someone who's also a father, 

06:58 
why wouldn't you buy this kidnapping kit? 

07:00 
So there's subconsciously now thinking, 

07:06 
therefore, I would want to take care of my family. 

07:14 
because otherwise, you're not a good father. 

07:15 
Now, you wouldn't necessarily say that. 

07:24 
that they're going to think unconsciously, 

07:29 
People trust things that are trusted by other people, 

07:33 
it has a thousand plus five-star reviews, 

07:35 
I kept seeing this all over TikTok. 

07:41 
So even though you're going to do this on your own, 

07:44 
and this little review was kind of X, Y, and Z, 

07:55 
Is there something I should have known about?
