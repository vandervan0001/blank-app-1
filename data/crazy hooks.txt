00:05 
Yo, what's going on guys? So, we got an extremely, extremely important video. 

00:13 
Yo, what's going on guys? So... 

00:16 
We got an extremely, extremely important video, maybe one of the most important videos you will watch when it comes to TikTok organic, creating killer hooks. 

00:24 
Okay, what's a hook? 

00:26 
The hook is the first one to three seconds of your video. 

00:29 
A hook can make or break a video. 

00:30 
I'd say, you know, 70% of success on TikTok is your hook. 

00:34 
Like, it depends on your hook. 

00:35 
The goal of the hook is to grab someone's attention and make them keep watching. 

00:38 
A couple other ways to think about it is a pattern interrupt or clickbait. 

00:41 
So pattern interrupt is meaning, like, people are just scrolling on the For You page, right? 

00:45 
And they're kind of in this pattern, in this kind of flow of just scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, right? 

00:48 
Your goal is to stop them. 

00:50 
You know, you want to stop them in their tracks, interrupt their pattern, interrupt them, and give them something that they're going to be like, whoa, what's this? 

00:54 
I'm going to stop. 

00:55 
I'm going to watch this video, right? 

00:56 
So, you know, clickbait is a good one. 

00:58 
Like, on YouTube, you're scrolling, looking for a video to watch, and some video is like, how this man made $100 million, right? 

01:02 
And boom, that just grabs your attention, you know. 

01:05 
it hooks you in, right? That's, that's the goal of this. So try to think about it like that, 

01:08 
but let's go, let's talk more about this. What makes a good hook? I believe there's two parts 

01:12 
that go into creating a perfect hook. So the text and the visuals, a lot of people think it's just 

01:16 
the text, but honestly, visuals might be even more important. So let's talk about that. The text 

01:20 
should instantly intrigue people. You know, how I got rich overnight. Have you heard of this hidden 

01:23 
town underground? You know, something that's like, you know, clickbait almost, like I mentioned, 

01:26 
something that's going to intrigue people, grab their attention, shock them, blah, blah, blah. 

01:30 
um that's your goal with the text and the text can be extremely powerful now the goal with visuals 

01:34 
is to grab their eyes and make them look at something you know make it look interesting 

01:37 
confusing weird pleasing etc so the best hooks out there are visual hooks in my opinion and it's 

01:40 
because something weird is happening like there's this one that was uh people have been using a lot 

01:44 
recently where they'll stitch it because it's just a girl with like it's like a pretty girl 

01:47 
with good lighting and she has like something in her mouth she's playing with and it like it just 

01:50 
grabs your attention right and people are stitching that and then just using that for the first two 

01:53 
seconds and then talking about something else right so it's like these visuals can be super 

01:56 
super powerful if you can figure it out so you've you've all probably seen these videos where the 

02:00 
subway surfer um is at the bottom of the screen just playing um you know so why does that work 

02:04 
it's because it gives your eyes something to look at and entertains them and this is a good way to 

02:07 
think about the visuals in a hook you need to do the same the same concept with your give their 

02:10 
eyes something so like in the same way your eyes are kind of pleased you're like satisfied by 

02:14 
subway surfers you can kind of think about that as your visual hook too like there's something 

02:18 
visually there to kind of grab your eyes to look at blah blah i just thought that was a good thing 

02:21 
to include in there because it's a good example so let's look at some real examples 

02:23 
okay 

02:24 
okay 

02:26 
okay so this is two months ago someone crashed into my mercedes boom there's your text hook 

02:30 
it's pretty solid talks about you know crashing mercedes right that's something pretty pretty 

02:34 
interesting pretty crazy pretty shocking um it's not it's not boring then the other thing is he's 

02:38 
holding this like mirror looking object in his hand and kind of like flashing light in your eye 

02:41 
kind of just like kind of grabs your attention that way now this isn't the greatest look ever 

02:44 
but it kind of he kind of hits on the two things pretty well the text and the visuals 

02:47 
it grabs your attention 

02:49 
so let's look at another example here so have you 

02:56 
ever eaten peelable fruit candy boom there's your text that's it's weird it's like wait what's 

03:00 
peelable fruit candy you're like okay let's see what this is and boom look at this like this is 

03:03 
just visually like satisfying it's like all these little things they look squishy and please pleasing 

03:08 
on the eye and then they even go straight into this where they're like peeling the candy 

03:11 
it's super satisfying you know satisfying that is on your eye that's a good example of a visual 

03:16 
hook as well all right when these videos go it's just annoying to switch sides okay here's another 

03:23 
one so let's just watch it first 

03:26 
this is more of a visual hook but there is still this like is it still nicotine that's kind of your 

03:33 
text hook but you know not not really the main thing here this one's more visual based so it 

03:36 
instantly intrigues you because you're like what is he about to pull out of his boot right within 

03:40 
the first second you're like what is that what is he doing like what is he grabbing 

03:42 
see like that it's that simple sometimes you just got to intrigue people like 

03:48 
You're just like 

03:48 
just like, what's going on? What did you just grab? What is he getting? And then it 

03:50 
goes straight into his product, and it's a really good video as well. 

03:57 
I showed you a few examples. It's really important. Have a good 

03:58 
text. Have a good visual. 

04:00 
Those two things together can make really, really good hooks. 

04:02 
But let's talk more. Don't just repeat the 

04:04 
same hook over and over again. 

04:06 
You want to try new backdrops, new angles, new lighting 

04:08 
with text, without text, etc. Try everything 

04:10 
split test, and then once you find a hook that works, repeat 

04:12 
it and slightly change it to improve it. 

04:15 
Or slightly change it slash improve it. 

04:17 
So this is kind of just talking about, you know, 

04:18 
these are good hooks that I showed you, right? 

04:20 
It might have taken this guy 

04:22 
tons of different videos to actually come up with this hook. 

04:24 
Who would have thought, oh, I'm going to grab something out of my book while I'm 

04:26 
standing on a balcony or whatever it is. It's really random, 

04:28 
but it works, right? And how did he come up with this? Probably just by trying 

04:32 
So that's kind of what this part is about. 

04:33 
You want to just try a bunch of different hooks. 

04:34 
And if something's not working, just keep testing more. 

04:37 
I hate when I come across a TikTok account and they're like, oh, why am I not going viral? 

04:40 
And I look at every single hook is basically the same. 

04:42 
Like maybe they changed some words and the lighting's a little different, but it's like 

04:45 
they keep using the same backdrop or like the texts are always kind of the same. 

04:48 
It's like, try different stuff, guys. 

04:49 
You need to just test everything. 

04:52 
Okay, so I think that's it for this video. 

04:55 
Hooks, like I said, extremely powerful. 

04:57 
It's going to be something you get better with over time. 

04:58 
You'll kind of, you'll learn and you'll study it more. 

05:00 
But I think a lot of people struggle with, which I just want to touch on this last point 

05:03 
before I end this, is the visual part of it. 

05:05 
A lot of people I see, they'll have good text hooks and then the visual will just be like 

05:08 
a white wall in the background or like in their bedroom, like something boring. 

05:12 
So you really need to take advantage of the visual part of it. 

05:14 
Like add something in there that's, you know, hold out your product maybe in the sun or 

05:17 
you drop your product in the water. 

05:19 
You throw your product off a balcony, like do something crazy, man. 

05:21 
You got to be creative with this. 

05:22 
Come up with something that's kind of visually appealing, satisfying, you know, like we talked 

05:26 
Come up with something that's going to grab their eye, really intrigue them. 

05:31 
And yeah, this is a pretty important one. 

05:36 
But no, it's better this way. 

05:40 
Try playing with it. 

05:42 
Well, we'll be better when we're together. 

05:45 
Oh, my God! 

05:47 
There's a lot of stuff! 

05:50 
There's a lot of stuff! 

05:53 
There's a lot of stuff.
