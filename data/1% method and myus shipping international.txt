The 1% method. 

00:08 
What is the 1%? 

00:08 
What is the Walker Center? 

00:09 
It's where your TikTok shop commissions are dropped down to 1% with the TikTok app and you are paid out the rest of what you are owed. 

00:13 
1% 

00:18 
Please make sure to do this before you start making content selling it wrong. 

00:23 
Why do people do this? 

00:25 
To withdraw earned commissions from TikTok, your account needs to be in good standing, 

00:29 
meaning you can't be temporarily suspended or even banned. 

00:32 
It can't have anyone else's info on it, like their ID or SSN. 

00:36 
And you need to be a U.S. citizen. 

00:38 
Now, when I say it can't have anyone else's info on it, like their ID or SSN, 

00:40 
your SSN don't get 

00:41 
don't get, like, sketched out by that. 

00:43 
I promise it's not shady or anything. 

00:44 
It's just that if you purchase an account from somebody who was currently earning money from TikTok Shop in the past 

00:50 
and withdrawing it, you need to submit your SSN to withdraw it. 

00:50 
and withdraw 

00:54 
And you can only do that once. 

00:55 
So they submit their information to take out their money. 

00:58 
Then they sell you the account just for whatever reason. 

01:00 
They're not using it anymore. 

01:01 
Then you won't be able to submit your information to take out the money. 

01:04 
So then now, you know, how would you get the money? 

01:07 
You have to go about the 1% method, which I'm explaining now. 

01:09 
So nothing is sketchy. Don't worry. 

01:12 
If your account is even temporarily suspended, you won't be able to withdraw commissions. 

01:16 
Or if you don't have a U.S. ID and SSN, you won't be able to withdraw them either. 

01:20 
So if you are anyone who is international or not a United States citizen, you won't be able to withdraw the commissions. 

01:28 
There are so many more complications that can occur that will cause TikTok to freeze your money or just simply not let you withdraw it. 

01:36 
If your account is permanently banned, your commissions could get locked. 

01:37 
ban, your commissions could get locked. 

01:41 
locked in there forever forever this one percent method gets rid of this problem completely before 

01:48 
it even happens how do i do it you send us your tiktok account username and then we send you an 

02:09 
invite to lower your commission by my say us for top shelf you would send it to me but if you're 

02:14 
working for a different brand uh through million dollar brand club you would send it to them or 

02:18 
that brand's manager and then they would lower your commission to one percent now this is how 

02:22 
you accept that lowered commission invite so first you would go to your inbox right here 

02:27 
You would go to your TikTok shop notifications, and then you would go to collab invites, 

02:31 
and then you would see an invite from the brand. 

02:35 
Assuming you check probably right after they sent it, it would likely be the top one, 

02:39 
and then you would just click on the little arrow to inspect it, 

02:41 
and you would say the brand name right here, invite, their seller score, item sold, whatever, 

02:47 
and then it would say what product they invited you for, and then you would just hit add all, 

02:51 
and you should be good to go. 

02:54 
After you accept the invitation, feel free to start selling. 

02:58 
You may notice your commissions on your TikTok shop dashboard appear very low, 

03:03 
but that is a good sign. 

03:05 
That means it worked. 

03:06 
When the time comes for you to get paid your commissions, 

03:09 
contact the manager of the brand you're running. 

03:12 
It's me if it's Top Shelf Garage, so contact me for Top Shelf 

03:15 
or the manager of whatever other brand you're running, 

03:17 
and send a screenshot of the revenue generated as proof of how much you are owed. 

03:23 
And then the manager will confirm with you how much commission you are owed. 

03:36 
So for example, say for top 12 crime you did the 1% and you did $100,000 in rent. 

03:39 
And you did a hundred. 

03:43 
then you would send me that screenshot and I would go, oh, it says you've got $100,000 

03:46 
You've got a hundred thousand dollars. 

03:48 
in your bag, therefore you are owed 20% of that. 

03:51 
You are owed $20,000. 

03:52 
Thank you for listening to that. 

03:53 
Look at the pieces. 

03:56 
In fact, when you go to bed, you will see the pieces of the bed. 

03:58 
Yeah, but they're showing me a deluxe with a card. 

04:02 
Yes, that is correct, because it's probably the worst. 

04:03 
Or if it's 30% commission, you're owed 30,000. 

04:06 
Whatever the percent is, we'll work out the math there. 

04:08 
We'll work out the man. 

04:09 
I know Top Shelf runs things where we offer high commission. 

04:11 
we offer. 

04:13 
Shout out Top Shelf. 

04:14 
Y'all are going to make so much money with Top Shelf. 

04:16 
Side note, it's just so cool. 

04:18 
But anyways, we'll confirm. 

04:19 
And once we mutually agree on the commission you are owed, 

04:23 
then you'll go ahead and just simply send over an invoice 

04:24 
energy 

04:25 
and we will get that paid for you. 

04:27 
Or whatever brand you're working with, we'll get that paid for you. 

04:29 
You can do PayPal, Stripe, really anything works. 

04:35 
Really, it's for anyone? 

04:36 
You have to do it if you are not a current U.S. citizen, but it's recommended everyone does it. 

04:41 
Better safe than sorry. 

04:41 
safe than sorry. 

04:44 
Make sure you trust the brand. 

04:45 
Make sure. 

04:47 
I cannot vouch for it. 

04:47 
I cannot vouch for any other brands apart from Top Shelf Grind and Million Dollar Brand Club brands. 

04:49 
I shall super honestly spend a million dollars. 

04:52 
If you intend to do this with other clients and brands, please make sure you trust them. 

04:59 
And that is all. Thank you for watching. 

05:01 
As always, if you have questions, I'm here to help. 

05:03 
Thank you for watching. 

05:33 
This is how you solve it. 

05:34 
You're going to want to use MyUS. 

05:38 
You sign up, and they give you a United States address to ship product. 

05:42 
Then, once the package arrives at that address they gave you, it's one of their warehouse shipping facilities in Florida. 

05:49 
They then reship it to your home address. 

05:53 
And your home address can be located anywhere in the world, and they'll be able to send it to you. 

05:57 
This is because some companies do not ship products internationally or outside of the continental Unites. 

06:03 
It's not free. 

06:06 
Now, it is a bit of a situational thing, depending on the customs in your country. 

06:10 
And I have never used this myself, because I do live in the United States. 

06:13 
But as far as I know, you will have to cover custom fees and pay a small fee just for them to do this service for you. 

06:21 
We are not affiliated with them. 

06:23 
This is the only site I know of that does this and has worked consistently. 

06:28 
I know many people who have used them successfully, hence why I am recommending them. 

06:33 
The link to their site is below. 

06:40 
That is all. Thank you.
