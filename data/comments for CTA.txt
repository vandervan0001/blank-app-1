00:09 
yo what's going on guys so i want to make a quick video here going over 

00:14 
how to optimize the comment section to boost virality and increase conversions so the first 

00:21 
part of this video is going to be about a little trick that you can use to boost virality and then 

00:25 
the second part of this video which you really need to watch is how to increase your conversions 

00:28 
using the comment section which is extremely important that something every every single 

00:30 
person should be doing so firstly this is the tick tock right here i pulled up from luke belmar 

00:34 
where he talks about basically engagement farming on facebook and this video kind of explains my 

00:40 
point and like what i'm about to be telling you guys in a second unfortunately on loon the volume 

00:42 
doesn't work when you watch videos if you want to watch this you can go to this profile and find it 

00:44 
on there but basically he's just talking about how he used to farm engagement by starting conversations 

00:48 
in the comment section and when facebook ads would see that engagement it would lower your cpms 

00:52 
because facebook sees as a you know engaging post that people want to see basically so that same 

00:56 
concept can be applied to tick tock organic and i've done this in the past and it's definitely 

00:59 
something you guys should give a try so basically you go into the comment section and respond to 

01:02 
comments with questions or with things that you know people is going to spark conversations and 

01:06 
get more replies because how tick tock works the more engagement your video gets hence comments 

01:09 
the the more tick tock will push it um and make it viral so 

01:12 
basically you see a comment that says you know uh this is an interesting product like what's it 

01:17 
from and then you respond like oh have you never heard of this it's from blah blah i don't know 

01:20 
you you kind of respond to comments getting people to respond to you again and you can do this from 

01:23 
your main page your business page but be careful with doing anything that's going to look 

01:27 
unprofessional uh you do want to be careful because the second year if you start trolling 

01:29 
people and saying all this stupid shit people are just going to look at you your business and it's 

01:32 
going to make it look unprofessional and they're going to lose trust and they're not going to buy 

01:33 
from you so if you do it from your branded page make sure you do it in a professional manner 

01:36 
if you want though you can go on a separate account and start you know then you can start 

01:39 
trolling and start talking shit start you know saying controversial 

01:42 
things in there to get people people talking but be careful doing that from the same device 

01:45 
maybe do it from a separate device device from your girlfriends your brothers or friends or 

01:48 
whatever uh but be careful with that but it is something you could test because we all know the 

01:53 
more comments a video gets the more likely it is to be pushed in the algorithm so that's kind of 

01:56 
the first concept definitely something you guys should give a try and let me know if you you know 

01:58 
come up with any creative ways to do it or have any success with it uh please let us know in the 

02:01 
discord but let's move on to the second part of this video which is something everyone should be 

02:04 
doing it's honestly a no-brainer so firstly i got a bunch of screenshots pulled up here for 

02:07 
examples and things i kind of want to talk about but first let's talk about ctas so this year 

02:12 
let me see okay this here is a good example of how you want to run your comment section okay so 

02:15 
the first comment people see the one the top comment you want to make sure it's a cta this 

02:19 
is a good example guys comment guys commented where you got it which is like illiterate but 

02:26 
you get the point um or like example like this where can i get this respond to a comment like 

02:29 
that with a video and it will show up at the top of the comment section you just make a video saying 

02:32 
hey if you want our product get it link in bio it's on sale something like this right all you 

02:35 
have to do is plug a video with a strong cta below this and boom tiktok pushes it to the top of the 

02:39 
comment section because you're buying the video that's just how tiktok works and now everyone 

02:42 
your comment section this is the first thing they see a call to action to buy your product 

02:44 
which is obviously very very good um and then here's a bad example so this video this is the 

02:49 
top comment says pickle jar and then you respond to the video like you know showing it with a 

02:52 
pickle jar whatever cool idea but you're missing out on a lot of conversions because you're not 

02:55 
making a clear cta the first thing people see um which is really really important 

02:58 
And then another thing I want to mention is I see some people do this, where they'll respond to a comment like, where can I get this video, which is good, but it won't be the top comment because they'll have other things flooding the top comment section like this. 

03:06 
You want this to be the first comment at the top. 

03:08 
You don't want it to be like five comments down because not as many people will see it. 

03:12 
Here's a good example or a bad example of what you shouldn't do. 

03:15 
Someone commented on this guy's video, where can I buy one? 

03:17 
All he did was like it. 

03:20 
He could have responded to this comment with a video saying, here's my product. 

03:23 
It probably would have doubled his sales because this would have popped up first thing at the top. 

03:27 
This guy just left a bunch of money on the table. 

03:29 
And unfortunately, I see this happen all the time because people just don't really know what they're doing or they're lazy. 

03:33 
Some people come into this space thinking, oh, I just have to get a Fiverr product, go viral on TikTok, and I'll make a bunch of money. 

03:38 
You need to make sure you're optimizing every step of the funnel, every step of the way. 

03:40 
So your content needs to look professional. 

03:42 
You need to have a strong call to action. 

03:44 
You need to have a high demand product. 

03:46 
It can't just be some random product that no one actually cares to buy. 

03:50 
I mean, usually that's the highest converting product. 

03:52 
But yeah, there's a lot to it. 

03:53 
If you really want to convert at a higher level than just 5 million views and 10 sales, which I unfortunately see all the time because people just don't really know what they're doing. 

03:58 
Here's another example. 

03:58 
If you don't want to respond to the video for whatever reason, you can't film one or whatever, you can respond with text, like details in our bio, which is better than nothing. 

04:06 
He just said details in our bio. 

04:07 
That's a subtle, simple CTA. 

04:08 
Not as good as responding to the video, but it does help. 

04:13 
Just so you know, it will get censored. 

04:15 
You can put that little comment or that little emoji of the paperclip, which people use as a link. 

04:20 
So put that paperclip emoji then in bio. 

04:23 
You can get creative with shit like that. 

04:25 
So yeah, that's kind of it for the CTA, which is really one of the most important things. 

04:28 
But another thing I want to talk about is social proof in your comment section. 

04:31 
So right here, this is an example. 

04:32 
I wanted to find some better examples for this, but I'll kind of explain it to you guys. 

04:34 
So you want to make sure when people go to your comment section, not only is there a 

04:36 
CTA, but there's no negative comments talking about things that are going to deter people 

04:40 
from buying your product or things like the obvious ones like dropshipping or you can 

04:44 
Obviously, you don't want those in there, but you can get rid of those with filter comments. 

04:46 
But even things like this, you want to make sure aren't around for people to see. 

04:50 
So I thought the point of an air fryer was to drain the excess fat off. 

04:52 
So this person brought up a solid point because the product you can't see here is kind of 

04:56 
this little bowl that goes inside the air fryer. 

04:58 
So you don't clean it so much, but it kind of defeats the purpose of the whole like the 

05:01 
drain that usually happens in air fryer. 

05:03 
If you don't talk about anyways, basically, this person's going against the product. 

05:05 
And personally, I would have deleted this comment because in my head, I'm going to read 

05:07 
this like, oh, yeah, that's a good point. 

05:08 
Maybe I shouldn't buy this product because it defeats the main purpose, right? 

05:10 
So you're deterring people from buying your products. 

05:13 
This guy didn't delete it, which this guy just obviously doesn't know what he's doing. 

05:16 
And comments like this, how the air can air. 

05:17 
Like, that's just kind of a joke. 

05:18 
I would leave that. 

05:19 
It doesn't really have a solid point against your product. 

05:23 
But yeah, things like this you want to get rid of. 

05:24 
Make sure you're monitoring your comment section. 

05:25 
There's no just obviously negative comments at the top of your comment section. 

05:29 
And then another thing you could do is that can be super helpful is having social proof 

05:32 
like, hey, I bought this product three weeks ago and I just got it. 

05:36 
Or you shouldn't say three weeks. 

05:37 
You should like five days because it looks like you have faster shipping. 

05:39 
Like positive comments from people saying like, oh, I need this or this is a really 

05:42 
Stuff like that is what you want people to see because that's going to make people think 

05:45 
like, oh, yeah, yeah, other people want this. 

05:46 
This is something I want or this is a good product, right? 

05:49 
When other people want something, people want more, right? 

05:52 
But I think that's kind of everything. 

05:54 
I wish I had some better examples. 

05:55 
I was trying to look and find really anything at the moment. 

05:57 
But I think you guys got all the points. 

05:59 
Make sure you are optimizing your comment section. 

06:01 
Basically, the whole point that I'm trying to get across in this video, don't just post 

06:04 
a video, let it go viral and just let the comments do what they do. 

06:06 
You need to be in there daily, making sure you're deleting bad comments, responding to 

06:09 
people, asking where to get this, making sure the CTA shows up at the top, things like 

06:12 
So hopefully this video is helpful. 

06:14 
The first thing I mentioned in this video about farming engagement, if you do that, 

06:18 
I would love to hear what you come up with or how it goes for you because that's still 

06:20 
kind of a newer concept, not something everyone needs to be doing as much compared to something 

06:26 
But anyways, that's it. 

06:32 
So I want to make a quick video here going over how to optimize. 

06:39 
How to.
