00:02 
Anyways, this video is going to be about creating strong TikTok shop hooks. 

00:07 
First things first, you want to remember people are just kind of spam throwing their For You page, right? 

00:13 
And your ultimate goal with the hook is to get someone to stop in their tracks, right? 

00:17 
To grab their attention and get them to stop right there on your video and continue watching your video, right? 

00:22 
Like that's how you need to think about the hook. 

00:24 
Like that's the whole goal of the hook, to get someone to stop and snag their attention, get them to continue watching your video. 

00:30 
Instead of them just scrolling past your video because it just doesn't grab their attention or appeal to them in any way. 

00:39 
So the strongest way to do this is emotion, emotion, emotion, emotion, right? 

00:42 
And these are the five strongest kind of types of emotion you can use to grab people's attention. 

00:49 
So fear, greed, sex, status, love. 

00:52 
I'm not going to really explain these too much, but there's another video in the course that Luca made. 

00:58 
I was just watching it. 

01:00 
You know, pretty deep. 

01:01 
Talks about the psychology behind it all. 

01:03 
So if you want to get more in-depth stuff, you can go watch that later on. 

01:06 
But anyways, let's get into some examples here. 

01:08 
So the first one, this one's like shocking, right? 

01:11 
Like you're kind of shocking people a bit, but it's like still realistic, relatable. 

01:18 
But let's watch this. 

01:19 
So first of all, or firstly, she does play into the sex emotion here, right? 

01:24 
You'll notice that straight away. 

01:28 
I just finished getting the best head of my entire life and I'm a hundred percent. 

01:33 
Yeah, so that's what it is. 

01:36 
I just finished getting the best head of my entire life. 

01:39 
I just finished doing the best head of my entire life, right? 

01:41 
And this video, I mean, it did – I think it did, like, six figures for her. 

01:47 
It did so well, which I'm sure has a good amount to do with how good that hook was. 

01:52 
And she makes it seem so, like, real, and she's, like – she's actually telling a story. 

01:58 
That's one thing Sydney's really good at, you know. 

02:00 
She makes it feel real. 

02:02 
So let's see. 

02:06 
Yeah, that's the first example, kind of, like, shocking, you know. 

02:08 
Say something that's going to – not boring, right? 

02:10 
Like, there's nothing boring about I just got the best head of my entire life, right? 

02:13 
Like, it's going to be like, oh, like, okay. 

02:16 
So, yeah, that's the first example. 

02:17 
Now, another thing that's very powerful is, like, negative hooks, right? 

02:22 
The – going back to, like, the fear here, right? 

02:25 
So negative hooks, you know, kind of putting – using fear is way stronger than positive, right? 

02:32 
Like, saying, oh, this product's really great doesn't really – no one cares, right? 

02:36 
But if you say, oh, my God, do not. 

02:38 
Do not use this product, it instantly grabs you. 

02:40 
That's just human psychology, right? 

02:42 
You play – you pay more attention to the negative. 

02:44 
So here's a good example of a negative hook. 

02:49 
Please be very careful before you start taking Soursop, y'all. 

02:52 
Please be very careful before you start taking Soursop, bitters, 

02:55 
because this shit right here will expose the truth about all- 

03:00 
basically just saying, please be careful before you start taking this. Right. That instantly just 

03:04 
like grabs his attention. Then he goes on to basically say like the product's so good that 

03:09 
it's like, you know, he twisted into being a good thing of course. But, um, yeah, negative hooks. 

03:15 
Like when I used to really make a lot of content, this was, this was my bread and butter. Like just 

03:21 
anything negative for, you know, whatever reason, it just grabs people's attention. 

03:25 
Okay. The next thing, this one I really, really love. Um, and I was talking to Luis before this, 

03:31 
he kind of gave me some ideas for some of these videos and helped me with some examples. 

03:35 
And these are some of the things he said, but so calling them out, right? Like this whole 

03:39 
right like 

03:40 
targeting a certain group of people, you're literally just like calling them out, like 

03:44 
very personally. Right. So what Luis said was when he was selling the 15 day cleanse, a lot of, 

03:49 
um, his hooks were like, if you're struggling with inflammation or can't poop regularly, 

03:55 
that, that's just a perfect example of like calling someone out, right? If you have this 

03:59 
issue, if you have this and this issue, like keep watching this video. If you have, you know, 

04:04 
gut issues, you can't poop regularly, keep watching this video. So now every person that 

04:08 
has those issues, instantly you have their attention, instantly, right? So, oh, the other 

04:15 
thing he mentioned was, like, this type of hook works extremely well because the people 

04:19 
watch your video, like, they connect with it right away, right? So, like, when you talk 

04:25 
about issues someone has and they have it, boom, there's a connection, right? And then 

04:28 
what that also does is it makes them more likely to buy because he was telling me how 

04:35 
every time he used this type of hook, it seemed like it would convert higher, right? So he'd 

04:39 
get more sales. So that's another, you know, huge benefit. But let's look at some examples 

04:45 
always breaking up like this if your skin is always breaking up like this or like this 

04:51 
it's not just acne you probably have a damaged skin there 

04:54 
Right. So pretty simple. She's just calling out people with these type of skin issues. 

04:58 
So anyone that watches this video. 

05:01 
and they have these you know these same issues they're instantly hooked right they're like oh 

05:05 
i have this how do i you know what is she going to say is she going to give me a way to fix this 

05:09 
issue i have in my own life right so instantly connected grab their attention amazing hook 

05:14 
here's another one here 

05:18 
For all my sweaty queens who are so scared of the summer, fear not. 

05:21 
This will make your makeup last all freaking day. 

05:23 
Yeah, so boom, just calling someone out, right? 

05:26 
For all my sweaty girls out there, like, any girl that's, like, concerned about, you know, she sweats a lot, she smells, like, she's instantly hooked in on this video, right? 

05:34 
Another perfect example. 

05:36 
So, yeah, that's the targeting a specific group type of hook. 

05:40 
So, so far, those are, like, three different types of hooks you guys can use. 

05:43 
Another thing, like, little piece of advice here is kind of just seeing what other videos are going viral and what the hooks they're using and just kind of copy and adjust to your product. 

05:54 
So, like, an example, it's so simple sometimes, but it's, like, you come across this video and it's, like, for all my sweaty girls out there, blah, blah, blah, that's the hook, right? 

06:05 
And it worked, you know, this video, I mean, this video didn't do crazy good. 

06:08 
But, like, if you see a viral video and it works, it's, like, okay, this hook works. 

06:12 
How can I apply it to my video? 

06:14 
So, instead of for all my sweaty girls out there, maybe I say for all my short kings out there, for all my short guys out there, and then it's, like, you know, your product's, like, a shoe that makes you taller or something, right? 

06:24 
So, just, like, kind of taking other hooks and using them to your own, right? 

06:27 
That's a good tip and honestly one of the simplest tips, but some people forget about that. 

06:34 
So, last thing, visual hook, right? 

06:36 
So, this is a little kind of, like, cherry on top. 

06:43 
So, what you'll notice here, instead of, instead of her just, like, opening this video with just her talking, she put the mouth tape over and, like, the first second of the video, she's, like, taking it off, kind of, like, and that's, like, a little thing for you to watch with your eyes, right? 

06:59 
It's a visual to watch. 

07:00 
If you're not taping your mouth shut. 

07:02 
Right. So that's like that could be your little cherry on top when you're you're coming up with a hook. 

07:08 
Right. The text and what you say is one thing which is really important. 

07:11 
But sometimes you add these little visual things that could kind of give someone's eyes something to look at. 

07:17 
And that can also help as well. And you push those two things together. 

07:21 
Great text hook plus a little bit of visuals. And that's that's like it's going to crush every time. 

07:26 
So that could be your facial reaction, you know, showing the product, maybe, you know, like this, pulling it off her face or, you know, whatever it is. 

07:36 
Even if you look over here like this, look at that. That's like that's a good visual right there. 

07:40 
A visual hook. It's like this guy's got a bunch of, you know, clear tape over his mouth, whatever. 

07:45 
That's another good example. But anyways, that's that's it for the hook video. 

07:49 
Like this is really all you. I know it's not a lot like it's very simple. 

07:53 
This is all you need to really make like banger banger hooks. 

07:56 
So hopefully this is helpful. I'll see you guys in the next one. Peace out.
