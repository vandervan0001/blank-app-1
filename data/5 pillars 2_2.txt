00:08 
businesses go viral okay your product but then your context all these things play together so 

00:12 
we're not just trying to make some neat content for consumption we're trying to make our businesses 

00:15 
go viral okay it's not about making ads and throwing shit in people's faces that we're 

00:17 
selling it we of course want to make it entertaining all that stuff but never be 

00:20 
afraid to say that you're a business for the art of selling it okay you will 100% get better at 

00:22 
this over time so let me show you some examples all right this will be a good mental practice 

00:25 
so when i look at this this is a really good or a bad example pause the video and try to figure 

00:29 
that out right now this is a good example of context or a bad example of context pause it 

00:31 
figure out all right cool if you don't pause it you're a bitch i'm just kidding but if you can 

00:35 
tell this is a really good one and this is a framework we talk about a lot with you guys 

00:37 
like storyline style content etc right when we start with the problem we go into the solution 

00:41 
aka your product and then the usps around it etc right i was trying to put my stuff on the floor 

00:44 
that's why i created this product this is what it does the other guy they talk more about in the 

00:46 
video very clear that when this video blew up it drove website visitors people interested in the 

00:49 
product whatever right people were in the comments say oh my god it's so amazing you know look at 

00:52 
why the whole video is just basically a really good entertaining ad with people who are actually 

00:55 
interested ding ding ding context all right now pause it and see about this one is this a good or 

00:59 
bad example all right cool obviously it's fucking trash why are they trying to make fucking this 

01:04 
this airpods didn't get fucked in the ass i don't know couldn't tell you but they thought that 

01:07 
all views are created the same it's got 45 million views and probably didn't even generate 

01:10 
150 site visitors because it's just funny content for consumption okay it doesn't matter they try 

01:13 
to do this get three in one target today like why would you ever want to buy from this right this 

01:15 
goes into the trust pillar as well a lot of these pillars will overlap but you guys get the sense 

01:18 
you also understand well some people will tell people oh but they said the product it doesn't 

01:21 
it might be funny people supported no no one's doing that no no one's doing that you might get 

01:24 
five ten people do that off 25 million views like shut up um like that's fucking useless but uh 

01:28 
they're also like well they plug the product and they show it the thing is is that in this video 

01:32 
they actually only get people that are extremely interested in the product and are fully sold on 

01:35 
it right you warm people up with the problem solution 

01:37 
unique selling points benefits etc so by the end they're ready to fucking purchase by here just 

01:41 
throwing in someone's face the same thing people do with call to actions they don't earn their 

01:42 
call to actions you just burn it you just no one's interested then you wonder why you didn't 

01:45 
sell anything this is why guys you have to make sure you have proper build up have people sold 

01:48 
this is never going to do anything all right third example wild card is this a good example 

01:51 
or not positive you don't come back all right good or bad example had uh 8.5 million views 

01:58 
product trash that's what it was um well it wasn't as bad as this to be honest but it's a different 

02:03 
style of trash okay basically the reason this video went viral entirely like the first 150 

02:06 
top comments were about this comment right here 

02:07 
that's the problem number one over controversy you know took them away from the actual product 

02:12 
was not subtle controversy built around the product that that no no no not good okay not good 

02:15 
second they made it look like it was genuinely a school project there was nowhere in this video 

02:18 
where they're talking about this infinity van actually being for sale it genuinely looks like 

02:21 
a school project like you have to understand these people don't know that you're fucking 

02:23 
selling these products unless you kind of make that clear context does this make sense are the 

02:26 
buttons clicking are the fucking light bulbs turning i really hope they are the light bulbs 

02:28 
turning on and the gears turning because i hope they are this is like making a school project 

02:31 
imagine you had no idea what the fuck was going on imagine you had no idea would you be able to 

02:33 
figure out that product is being sold and would you be sold on buying it now you understand context 

02:37 
video and start looking for other ones on all product video saves look through our swipe file 

02:40 
all that kind of stuff um now you have ctas right this is another one that people already know for 

02:44 
tiktok but think of the wrong way and i want to make sure you guys have this grasp ctas go hand 

02:46 
in hand with context and can be a huge huge benefit in combination but you need to be careful 

02:49 
um so a subtle cta at the end of the video when the caption is usually enough i want you guys 

02:52 
to understand that just saying like a little link in bio whatever right but you have to make sure 

02:54 
that you earn it that you burn it okay you cannot just put some dumb ass video like this and be like 

02:59 
oh my god don't look at the template link in bio get your charger today fuck no you're not earning 

03:03 
like i said i just explained you the walkthrough of how like why this doesn't work it's also 

03:05 
stupid with this much controversy but if the person is 

03:07 
not sold by the time you put the cta you did not earn it okay you want to make sure by the time 

03:10 
you're putting the cta it would not make sense to not include it does that make sense it would not 

03:14 
make sense to not include it by the time you get to the cta they should be sold on the product 

03:17 
understand the value and literally just want some extra information on where to go your link in bio 

03:20 
okay so for example with my swimwear brand you know we would do stuff like you know here are 

03:23 
all the different colors this one there's this one this one's hot cool blah blah blah blue purple 

03:25 
blah blah it'd be like 20 seconds going through a product people are like whoa whoa whoa watching it 

03:28 
and at the end they say if you want to check them all out like it's a bio you see what i'm saying 

03:31 
that's the kind of shit that would do six figure months off just organic with those kind of 

03:33 
products where we would earn the amazing context showing that we're selling business this is our 

03:36 
swimsuits this is our product verbiage matters by the way guys free sauce make sure you're writing 

03:39 
this down you know really easy way to set context is your verbiage um instead of saying like i got 

03:42 
this product for my dad which kind of sounds like you're like a weird influencer or something like 

03:44 
that being like um i let my dad try our first samples of our business you know think about 

03:48 
that right it gives it more of a sense of a business when you give a business and it goes 

03:50 
viral people usually want support um but back to my product stuff by the end it literally wouldn't 

03:54 
have made sense to not include a cta if people want to know what to purchase but you just do 

03:56 
some stupid short-term quick shit you know where people can't really tell what's going on it's 

03:59 
usually a better rule of thumb to leave out the cta maybe you can put it in the caption just put 

04:01 
like you know whatever your caption is and then parentheses link is in bio for the product by 

04:03 
the way that works too but just make sure you're smart about it don't throw it down people's throats 

04:06 
don't slap it in their face and try your best to always earn it okay it doesn't have to be crazy 

04:09 
you don't have to have them go through a whole fucking vsl on why they need to buy your product 

04:12 
to include it but you guys know what i mean use your best judgment we'll get better at it 

04:14 
through this program okay i trust the process um and also do not listen to any of the motherfucking 

04:31 
stupid you can put link in bio you don't have to put one you don't have to put an exclamation 

04:34 
point and shit and just put link in bio and you'll be fine okay you just can't type it out 

04:37 
in comments it's a weird thing i think they do to prevent scams in the comments you're good 

04:44 
all right now that we're moving on i hope this is good trust this is a very basic one you know 

04:47 
filming on iphone is great on tiktok the beauty of tiktok right you can film from your little 

04:49 
little iphone right here but don't take that for granted okay still have proper lighting and all 

04:52 
this kind of stuff like we talked about and don't get on there with some dirty ass location 

04:56 
dirty ass shoes trying to put fucking peanut butter on them and having your toes hang out 

05:00 
that are clipped and have fun guys if you want to get on there with some dirty ass shoes trying to 

05:01 
get sales off your views guys i've seen ones where they literally look like they're in the 

05:03 
bedroom of a hoarder's house selling this product and i look at this video i'm like yo keep me the 

05:07 
fuck away from this thing whatever it is i don't even care if it's an influencer keep me the fuck 

05:09 
away from it and of course you're never gonna get sales i've seen it dramatically affect people's 

05:12 
back-end sales conversions just use your best judgment again guys if you make it look like it's 

05:15 
a school project where you're digging around like clearly not someone who's kind of serious in 

05:18 
business it's usually not a good look okay so have some viewer empathy and make sure i say just make 

05:21 
sure you're happy for engagement makes sense okay yeah so um have some empathy for your viewers 

05:24 
that's very important all of you put your shoes uh put yourself in the shoes of your viewer right 

05:27 
if it looks like a fucking hoarder's apartment it's probably not that great go outside if you 

05:29 
have to fucking go to your friend's house bedroom whatever you do if you're gonna do some weird 

05:32 
half for engagement like putting people on your feet don't do it because that shit's trash okay 

05:34 
make controversy around the product if you know you know so that should make sense right we're 

05:37 
going down the funnel product the big letter once we have a good product down we just need to make 

05:40 
content that has good context shows that we're selling the product shows that we're a business 

05:43 
once we sell the people and have them through the funnel on viral content we give them some 

05:45 
call to actions tell them where to go right a lot of them will naturally just do it alone from the 

05:47 
context we're gonna give them extra steps and got in there and we're gonna make sure they do this 

05:50 
by having trustworthy content that's well filmed on the tiktok phone whatever it's all gonna look 

05:53 
good last thing now so now we do that once you've got these four down it's time for the next step 

05:56 
the website so this is the last step of the funnel if you know first things you're gonna 

05:59 
send a fuck ton of traffic right people are gonna go to your website and want to purchase your 

06:01 
products and hopefully we'll send tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands or just thousands 

06:04 
whatever it is send a lot of visitors but this is a step a lot of people neglect and we'll have a 

06:08 
whole website building big in this program for you guys um we're gonna hire some people we'll 

06:11 
have some stuff so you guys can really improve them maybe you have people you can hire so we're 

06:13 
still working out those things so bear with me um but you need to make sure that your website 

06:15 
matches your marketing you also check these guys out on twitter we're gonna have a lot more for 

06:17 
you guys this is like a this line i just copied from twitter on some shit i had um so normie here 

06:20 
trust me this is good content all original no one else is getting this but i just copied this um 

06:23 
and you want to just do the game on your website it's very important if you know you know you know 

06:25 
once people go there that's your final stop of course that's a big part so try to focus you're 

06:29 
aligning you're aligning your marketing with your website brand make it all look good make it all 

06:31 
make sense clean easy people can purchase from we'll do a whole other job than that but just 

06:34 
know that we're diving down the funnel until we get to the last one which fucking sucks and this 

06:36 
is wrong country and audience and this is the one exception that can absolutely cancel out all the 

06:40 
other shit and that is when your video gets sent to a random country like indonesia philippines 

06:43 
etc iceland i've seen before um and that's just because tiktok private content would be good 

06:46 
there or something who knows because we don't know the algorithm um and obviously like these 

06:49 
people go crazy with it and it goes viral another country like the philippines where people can't 

06:52 
even purchase from you or something they'll all come to your website fucking murder your conversion 

06:54 
rate because none of them can purchase it's just kind of a shit show it happens there's nothing 

06:57 
you can really do about it from my experience it's usually completely random and you guys know 

06:59 
how there's bull runs and bear runs on viral tiktok videos where you might get two million 

07:01 
views the first week the second week it'll go on another run to another like maybe go up to four 

07:04 
million views and then sometimes we go on third fourth run down the line it'll go to five six 

07:07 
seven eight ten million whatever it is right if it's worthy i'm assuming it'll just send you more 

07:09 
views um and usually on that second third um like launch it'll go international right and that's 

07:14 
when you get dicked by this stuff so expect that to happen then it's always what happened to me 

07:17 
always happen my clients it's just not fun so make sure to check your tiktok post data and see 

07:20 
where the people are coming from if this ever happens use your conversion rate taking um and 

07:23 
check your website to see where the visitors are coming from to see if that matches should help 

07:25 
um recap these are my six pillars i hope you guys run them down use this as your checklist for 

07:29 
content and analyzing your own shit as you guys know it's something we preach a lot to analyze 

07:31 
your own shit if you want to learn more about just building out this great content keep watching
