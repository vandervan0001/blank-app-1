Why do you need to grow again? 

00:16 
You need to reach 1,000 followers to unlock the ability to put a link in your TikTok bio. 

00:21 
you need to reach 5,000 followers to unlock TikTok shop access and the ability to sell. 

00:27 
These are the only two times you should focus purely on account growth, 

00:31 
if you even want to focus purely on account growth and doing these. 

00:35 
If you are using the SYN VPN method, make sure everything is set up and turned on before making it. 

00:36 
After using the SIM VPN method... 

00:41 
I'll take care of the rest of them. 

00:43 
How to grow in here. 

00:44 
Well, I'm moving. 

00:44 
It is recommended to grow the account with the type of content you plan to make, for example, 

00:50 
If you plan to make slideshows for Amazon, it's best to grow the account with slideshows from the store. 

00:55 
If you change up, contest. 

00:58 
there's a possibility not a guarantee that your content may not do as good no matter 

01:03 
how good it is why because tiktok has an ideal viewer 

01:08 
who it shows your content to 

01:10 
after you've gone viral a couple times. 

01:12 
When you change the content type, 

01:13 
for example, slides to a talking head, 

01:14 
slides to 

01:16 
TikTok will keep showing your content 

01:18 
to that ideal viewer, 

01:19 
but they may not like what you've done, 

01:21 
but they may also like it if you don't know. 

01:24 
Now, to give a little more insight to this, think about it like this. 

01:27 
Say you go viral two times when you're growing an account. 

01:30 
You go viral twice about slideshows in the gym meet. 

01:33 
right? So at that point, the TikTok algorithm is going to look at your account and be like, 

01:38 
okay, so this person's gone twice, gone viral twice with slideshows in the gym beach. 

01:43 
So every post they make from now on, it's a pretty safe chance that people who like slideshows and 

01:50 
are in the gym niche are going to like this post. So we're going to show it to them. So now if you 

01:55 
switch up the content style from slideshows to talking head, it's still going to get shown to 

01:59 
the slideshow people. So they may like it, but they may not. Focus on getting followers in your 

02:07 
age. You want people who are interested in the product you plan to sell to follow. 

02:12 
Not because audience matters oh so much on TikTok, but more so because TikTok will once again think that is your ideal viewer and keep pushing your content to people who display it. 

02:15 
but more so through this TikTok. 

02:18 
That is your idea. 

02:20 
Thank you. 

02:23 
so if you grow your account by getting followers 

02:25 
your account 

02:26 
other needs 

02:26 
Other than that, no. 

02:28 
TikTok will likely show your content on the wall. 

02:29 
TikTok will likely show your content to the wrong people when it comes time to sell your product 

02:31 
When I'm about to sell your product. 

02:33 
because your account is already so in tune with the wrong audience. 

02:35 
ready so 

02:39 
Say you blow up twice, right? 

02:39 
Say you blow up twice. 

02:42 
You go to a viral post, they blow up a base of followers in the gym. 

02:43 
viral codes they blow up these 

02:46 
Then you're selling a product that people who go to the gym don't care about at all. 

02:46 
Then you're selling it. 

02:50 
But since you went viral in the gym niche twice, 

02:53 
TikTok's sitting here thinking, 

02:54 
all right, there's a good chance whatever post this account makes, 

02:57 
people in the gym niche are going to like it, 

02:58 
this year, we should go like, it's a lot better. 

02:59 
so I'm going to show it to them first. 

03:01 
But since you're selling something people in that niche don't care about, 

03:05 
They're not going to engage with it. 

03:06 
TikTok's going to be like, oh, all right, nobody engages. 

03:09 
I'll tell you she's cute. 

03:11 
Never buy followers. 

03:12 
It's not a shortcut. 

03:13 
It's not a short. 

03:15 
It will screw up your account so 

03:15 
It will screw up your account so bad, you'll have to start a new one, because TikTok will only show your content to your bot followers. 

03:24 
None will like because they're not real. 

03:26 
TikTok will think your content is bad because it's not what you put on your page. 

03:30 
This excludes purchasing accounts for Take Down Joker. 

03:31 
This excludes... 

03:35 
make viral content the easiest way to get followers is to go viral 

03:37 
Easy, sweetie. 

03:40 
The easiest way to go viral is to make quality, entertaining, or mechanical. 

03:44 
That can be done by following the course videos on each content style that one of the teachers 

03:49 
The only thing you can change up is instead of the CTA being to buy a product, you need 

03:49 
the only 

03:54 
to follow the one that did something similar. 

03:55 
What are you doing? 

03:57 
For example, if you change... 

03:59 
Get your testosterone boosted in my bio. 

04:05 
for more gym content right you see how this niche 

04:10 
In Toronto. 

04:10 
This problem correlates with this knee. 

04:12 
This knee. 

04:14 
Now this is a very simplistic example. 

04:16 
It's not always as black and white as this. 

04:20 
Don't be, oh, sales. 

04:20 
Oh! 

04:22 
But don't include them in a sale. 

04:24 
and you have a bro here. 

04:26 
through 

04:27 
molars. 

04:30 
Just have them as part of the video. 

04:32 
If you're talking on Twitter or something. 

04:32 
If you're talking about what are some things to grow your account at, 

04:35 
Oh, yeah. 

04:36 
mention how the one you plan to promote is one of your favorites and leave it at that. 

04:40 
I can't. 

04:41 
Once the time comes, though, be ready to sell. 

04:43 
Once the time comes. 

04:45 
And just to clarify, I'm not saying mention it, saying I intend to sell this later on. 

04:51 
Like, if you're just giving a list of your three favorite songs... 

04:57 
Be part of the list. 

04:59 
that's all. And then when it comes out, you can remake that. 

05:00 
And then when it comes time. 

05:03 
video where you give your three favorites, but then this time around, as you mentioned, 

05:08 
Let's watch it. 

05:09 
Hey, that's enough, that's enough now. 

05:11 
Again! 

05:12 
No, if I did, that's enough, otherwise I'm going to cry. 

05:15 
I really wanted to play. 

05:16 
What? 

05:17 
You can make content with a CTA to purchase a file before you even have a link in your 

05:24 
If you think that you can make a post go viral enough to get you 1,000 followers and still have a CTA to get a product in your bio, by all means, go. 

05:34 
The sale will likely start soon, but the downside is it is a bit harder to get that one close to. 

05:43 
because of this youtube note this is only for linkedin bio after a video has been posted 

05:52 
I'm going to drop him, he's not going to cry. 

05:52 
One, two, three, four. 

05:55 
What if I already have it? 

05:58 
Depending on what niche it was grown in, it can work. 

06:01 
If you have a fitness page, go ahead and call me. 

06:11 
If you have a page in a random page that you don't like, 

06:14 
I love you. 

06:17 
I'm so proud of you. 

06:19 
It's worth a shot, but remember everything I just went over. 

06:22 
If you purchase an account from someone, be wary of the audience and niche it was growing in. 

06:27 
This does not apply to purchasing TikTok shots. 

06:32 
TikTok shop account. 

06:34 
While yes, everything I said in here is important, 

06:37 
if you are purchasing a TikTok shop account from one of the suppliers I recommend, 

06:41 
do not worry about how it was grown, what type of content has been posted on it, 

06:47 
or anything like that. 

06:48 
Just make sure it works and you can access the TikTok shop. 

06:51 
The suppliers are skilled enough in how they grow the account 

07:01 
that it will be ready and able to work for any content style in any niche 

07:06 
or audience you want it to.
