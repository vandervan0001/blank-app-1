00:02 
Let's see if you're eligible for free shipping at 40% off. 

00:05 
Like, it doesn't have to be entirely true. 

00:07 
And hey, sometimes people do get those deals because it's the first time TikTok shop buyers, they do get those deals. 

00:13 
those deals so they think it's the product itself that's giving you 

00:14 
So they think it's the product itself that's giving the offer. 

00:17 
but it's just TikTok themselves. 

00:19 
So definitely get it to try and add it to the card. 

00:19 
So definitely get it to try and add it to the cart 

00:21 
and do everything in your power to do that. 

00:22 
You have an hour. 

00:24 
So, another thing that you can do is that, guys, you can basically lie about this. 

00:29 
Like, I'm not a big liar, but you can basically, like, over-exaggerate the truth. 

00:32 
So, like, you can say in your live, oh, my gosh, guys, three people are checking out right now. 

00:35 
Thank you. 

00:37 
Or two people just bought the product. 

00:38 
or spy people on doing the... 

00:39 
Or five people are doing the product right now. 

00:41 
Create some form of urgency and show people are buying the product and interested. 

00:45 
So, you can completely lie about this on what you say. 

00:48 
of what you say 

00:49 
So, like, say, oh, my gosh, guys, two people just bought the product. 

00:49 
so like 

00:49 
saying oh my god 

00:52 
Oh, my gosh. 

00:53 
this thing is selling out like crazy right now it's like two people might have not bought the 

00:57 
product but if people are on the fence about buying a product or not people will see you oh 

01:01 
my gosh like two people are buying the product like oh my gosh i do like this product is going 

01:06 
and selling out so fast or five people bring the product it's like you want to create some 

01:10 
form of urgency and also like be like guys like there's only a hundred that's in stock 

01:14 
and create that form of urgency like okay like i might not be able to 

01:15 
I don't think so. 

01:19 
don't buy it so you can be high about this but when people are checking out right now it's like 

01:26 
they don't know if people are checking out but they're taking your word for it and especially 

01:29 
if you're showing your face you already have that level of trust so it's very easy to try and 

01:31 
Don't you have that level of trust? 

01:34 
convince or just tell people that oh my gosh guys like five people just bought the product you know 

01:39 
But definitely create something from an urgency and you will cash out. 

01:43 
So the follow for follow method. 

01:45 
So you don't have to do this, but this is something that I used to do a lot. 

01:49 
Is that every time somebody would follow me, I would be like, oh my gosh, thank you so much, Elijah. 

01:55 
I'm going to follow you back right now. 

01:57 
And then once I did that, I got like 10 followers right there, right then. 

02:01 
I'm like, in my prime, I used to average like 500 to 600 viewers a live stream. 

02:05 
And that was constant 500, 600 viewers. 

02:07 
And every time somebody would follow me, I'd be like, oh my gosh, thank you so much for following me. 

02:12 
I'll follow you back right now. 

02:13 
And then as soon as I said that, you can just see like 10, 20, 30 people follow my account because I said that I would follow back. 

02:22 
And TikTok did this thing to where like I was following so many people back at once that like they stopped. 

02:27 
They didn't allow me to follow certain people back. 

02:31 
So after like I stopped following people back, then they would be like, oh my gosh, why didn't you follow me back yet? 

02:37 
Like I will follow back everyone after the live. 

02:40 
Just TikTok is not allowing me to do that. 

02:42 
And if you don't want to follow people back, you can still use this in your advantage by saying that you're going to follow people back. 

02:47 
And then you'll be like, guys, like if you want to follow back and hit me with a follow. 

02:51 
And then I will get to you after the live and I follow everyone back after the live. 

02:56 
And then after the live, it's like it doesn't matter. 

02:58 
It's like you don't have to follow people back. 

02:59 
But I personally follow people back just because I didn't care. 

03:02 
And I had like tens of thousands of followers that I just like I was following. 

03:07 
Like three, four thousand people. 

03:09 
And I really didn't care. 

03:11 
But if you're on an account, like you don't want a lot of people following or like you don't want to be following a lot of people. 

03:17 
You're going to be like, guys, like thank you so much for the follow. 

03:20 
And I follow everybody back at the end of the live. 

03:23 
And then people will start following you. 

03:24 
And then that with engagement, if TikTok sees that those like 10, 20, 30 people following you or like in a live, like hundreds of people following you. 

03:33 
And that's just because you're going to say you're going to follow them back. 

03:35 
That boosts engagement so much. 

03:37 
And I feel like this is one of the main reasons why like TikTok boosted me out so much was because I said I would follow people back. 

03:44 
And people ended up following me and they would see that like 30, 40 people following me. 

03:50 
And they'll be like, OK, we need to push this to more people because obviously people are following this guy and they're liking this content. 

03:55 
So this is actually a sauce method. 

03:57 
Whether you lie about it or whether you don't, it's definitely a thing that you should incorporate in your lives. 

04:01 
So, the free shipping method, even if the product isn't free shipping, say, add it to your cart to see if it's eligible for free shipping. 

04:07 
So, this is going back on the add it to your cart method of, like, it doesn't have to be free shipping, but sometimes TikTok ships products to people that, like, they do get free shipping. 

04:19 
So, like, you aren't entirely lying about this. 

04:21 
It's, like, you just want to add it to your cart at the end of the day to see if they are eligible for free shipping. 

04:26 
And if they are eligible, then cool. 

04:28 
If they're not, then be like, oh, like, I'm sorry you had to lock. 

04:30 
It must be, like, where you live. 

04:32 
Like, the specific area on where you live. 

04:34 
That's why. 

04:34 
That's why. 

04:35 
Don't, um, you know. 

04:37 
That's why you're not eligible for free shipping, but definitely use free shipping because people 

04:40 
love anything with free shipping. 

04:42 
And if you know anything about the econ game or the econ game, then you know that free 

04:46 
shipping is one of the best things that you can do. 

04:48 
So just say, add it to your cart to see if you're eligible for free shipping. 

04:52 
And again, like I said, that's the main thing that you guys want to drive through is for 

04:57 
them to add the product to your cart. 

05:00 
That's one of the main things that you guys need to be just running away with this. 

05:04 
But that's basically everything with TikTok Live, my personal sauce. 

05:09 
But guys, at the end of the day, it's all consistency. 

05:12 
It's all about how you can truly pioneer certain things in order. 

05:18 
I mean, like these five methods I just gave you guys, it's like I completely came up with 

05:23 
these and these were things I tested out to see if they work. 

05:25 
I didn't hear them from anybody else. 

05:27 
So I tell you, like you guys are getting the most sauce in the collective. 

05:31 
So I will try and pioneer you. 

05:34 
So other shit, there's a thousand other ways that you can go about doing TikTok Lives that 

05:38 
isn't even known about yet. 

05:40 
So definitely keep trying new stuff out, trying new ways to make content, do lives, whatever 

05:46 
And I want to see you guys kill it. 

05:49 
And if you guys watch this video, if it helped you in any way, then you guys can DM me in 

05:54 
And I want to see all of you killed. 

05:56 
I want to see a lot of people in the testimonials and the wins chat just saying how good they're 

06:04 
With lives, because I love to hear that. 

06:06 
But if you guys have any questions and DM me in the collective, but this was basically 

06:07 
If you guys have any questions. 

06:11 
And it's all about consistency. 

06:12 
It's all about not giving up. 

06:13 
You truly cannot fail in anything that you do in life. 

06:16 
And this is something I want to drive to you guys. 

06:17 
You cannot fail in life. 

06:20 
If you just simply don't give up, like when I tell you that it sounds cliche, you cannot fail at all. 

06:26 
If you just simply don't give up. And yes, you're going to have micro failures. 

06:30 
You're going to fail in a micro sense, but you cannot fail ultimately if you just never give up, if you just keep going. 

06:37 
So with lives, go live for a few hours a day, whatever the case may be, don't give up. 

06:41 
If you don't see viewership in the first few lives, don't let that like be a thing of, oh, like I'm in the gutter right now. 

06:48 
Oh, like I just never want to go live again because I'm getting no viewers. 

06:51 
It's like, no, just don't give up and you will see progress. 

06:55 
But if you guys have any questions, let me know. Hopefully this helped you out some. 

06:59 
And I want to see all you guys kill it. So, hey, I love y'all. Love y'all. 

07:16 
What are they? 

07:18 
TikTok shop lives are just as they sound. 

07:20 
It's where you go live on TikTok and sell a product, 

07:23 
similar to the shopping shop. 

07:25 
Your account will need TikTok shop access 

07:27 
to be able to do this. 

07:29 
Tutorial on how to go live. 

07:31 
It's easiest to have the product 

07:32 
in your showcase beforehand. 

07:34 
Make sure to pin the product and add flash sales. 

07:37 
Tutorial on the next slide. 

07:39 
All right, so first, this is me at the basic TikTok menu. 

07:48 
I'm scrolling over on the bottom right here 

07:50 
and I keep scrolling and then it says live right there. 

07:59 
And then I tap.
