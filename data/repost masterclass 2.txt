00:13 
Saved time, made more money, only made sense. 

00:16 
And I was getting bonuses on top of those retainers for having their posts blow up, stuff like that. 

00:22 
So, you know what I'm saying? 

00:24 
It didn't make sense for me to keep the ones on the lower retainer. 

00:27 
So you can also do that. 

00:29 
If you start getting good work done, then you start getting clients that pay you more. 

00:34 
You can start dropping the ones that are paying you less. 

00:36 
That way you save time, then you make more money. 

00:40 
Where you can repost, obviously, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube Shorts. 

00:48 
I posted on all these. 

00:49 
I posted on YouTube Shorts. 

00:52 
Got a lot of views there, too. 

00:54 
I posted some on TikTok. 

00:56 
Most of my successful clients were on Facebook. 

00:59 
And then Instagram, I had a few. 

01:02 
The ones that were paying me $100 a month, they were all on Instagram. 

01:06 
Facebook is really good. 

01:08 
You guys can keep in mind, if you guys come across people that are doing AI videos, 

01:14 
AI videos do really good on Facebook. 

01:18 
So, let's just keep that in mind. 

01:20 
If someone tells you that, let them know that you can post for them on Facebook. 

01:24 
Like, if they tell you, if you see they're doing AI videos for supplements or whatever, 

01:29 
let them know that those do good on Facebook. 

01:34 
One thing that I noticed is, 

01:36 
if they're making AI videos and you see that they're getting, like, 

01:41 
already, like, 1,000 views on their TikTok page from just on the AI videos, 

01:47 
if they're already, like, from what I've seen, 

01:50 
if they're already getting, like, 1,000 views on TikTok, 

01:54 
those are the ones that I've seen always blow up on Facebook. 

01:58 
You know what I'm saying? 

01:59 
So, that will help you keep in mind that you could actually help them blow up. 

02:06 
Just keep that in mind. 

02:10 
You can go a step further and ask them if their content is actually good 

02:15 
because you don't want to take on clients and their content sucks 

02:18 
and they're expecting you to blow up their post, 

02:20 
but all you're doing is reposting, 

02:22 
so you can't really do much about helping them blow up unless their content is good. 

02:32 
You're really interested in the stars, aren't you? 

02:35 
I often see him get on his bed too 

02:37 
So you can always look at their profiles and see if their content is any good. 

02:45 
And you can make your choice whether to take them on or not. 

02:50 
You know what I'm saying? 

02:52 
But like I said, if they're already getting like 500 to 1,000 views on AI videos on TikTok, those tend to blow up on Facebook. 

03:03 
I've reposted for Georgia, Nick, and for both of them. 

03:07 
I've gotten millions of views on Facebook. 

03:10 
I think Georgia alone, I did like 20 million views for her on Facebook from her AI videos. 

03:19 
If y'all know Nick with the dog profile picture, him as well. 

03:24 
There's a ton of posts already that I've made for him that are at a million views. 

03:31 
And like I said, that's where I'm getting bonuses because he works for Top Chef. 

03:36 
And if I'm not mistaken... 

03:37 
I think Top Chef offers them like 500 bucks for a million views. 

03:43 
So just do the math. 

03:45 
That's why he was able to give me a fat bonus. 

03:48 
So it's a good way to make money like that. 

03:52 
Like I said, he gave me a $1,000 bonus this month, like a few days ago. 

03:56 
Just from that alone, aside from my retainer. 

04:01 
So yeah, just keep that in mind. 

04:04 
Your client will usually let you know where they want you to repost. 

04:07 
Just make sure you're able to add more profiles on those platforms before you take their money. 

04:20 
You don't want to have to send them their money back. 

04:23 
Slide number eight, how to repost. 

04:28 
Your client will either send you a Google Drive, Dropbox, or they'll send you the social media profiles. 

04:34 
They'll want you to be downloading content from to repost. 

04:37 
And so they'll pretty much give you the gist of what to do for captions. 

04:43 
Those reposts for captions under the repost you'll be doing. 

04:48 
Just copy the captions from the original post. 

04:51 
And if they give you a drive or something, obviously there's going to be no captions. 

04:55 
So you have to come up with your own. 

04:57 
Just make sure they're good. 

05:00 
Just don't be doing some wild shit. 

05:04 
Or some lame ass. 

05:07 
Captions, you know what I'm saying? 

05:09 
You want to do a good job for them, pretty much. 

05:13 
Now for removing watermarks, if your client doesn't send you a Google Drive or a Dropbox, like I said, 

05:19 
they'll most likely give you the profiles they want you to download content from. 

05:23 
So you'll need to remove the watermarks before you post. 

05:27 
Obviously, you don't want to download it straight off TikTok and be reposting it with the watermarks. 

05:32 
They don't do good on platforms, and it's kind of a burn, too. 

05:37 
So, you know, it's just not a good look. 

05:41 
So removing watermarks from TikTok. 

05:45 
So I'm going to show you guys how to do this. 

05:47 
It's pretty simple. 

05:48 
You go on your browser. 

05:50 
It's a website called snapdick.app. 

05:53 
So what you do is... 

05:58

06:02
