00:07 
yo what's going on guys so in this video i'm going to basically be showing you guys 

00:11 
how to uh get the tiktok shop um affiliates set up and get 

00:19 
get reaching out to creators, get people posting for you, 

00:24 
So let's get right into it. 

00:26 
So once you have your TikTok shop account created, 

00:29 
you'll have this screen here and you're going to go to affiliate. 

00:30 
I'll go to that tab there and you'll click on get started. 

00:34 
So once you're here, all you need to do is create your shop plan, 

00:36 
your open plan really quick. 

00:39 
And then once you have those set up, you're basically, 

00:42 
And now it's, you know, it's time to start reaching out to creators. 

00:44 
So when it comes to reaching out to creators, 

00:46 
I suggest doing at least 250 a day. 

00:48 
creators are kind of getting spammed with messages more and more. 

00:53 
And if you can get a VA on this, 

00:55 
it's pretty simple to have a VA do this for you 

00:56 
because you're just gonna have message templates 

00:57 
that you send out so they can just spam them all day. 

00:59 
Get them doing like 500 messages a day. 

01:00 
So when it comes to reaching out to creators, 

01:03 
you'll be on this screen right here 

01:04 
and then just go to either click like more than 1K followers 

01:05 
or magic category, whatever, do more. 

01:08 
So once you're here, you can click your niche that you want 

01:11 
or you can just go broad, both work. 

01:13 
And then right here, you go to followers. 

01:15 
you wanna do obviously over 5,000 followers, 

01:17 
but you can do over 50, you know, over 10, whatever. 

01:22 
And then you can scroll through here. 

01:24 
As you scroll down, there'll just be tons and tons of creators. 

01:25 
And whatever one you're interested in, 

01:28 
you click on their name and it'll bring you to their profile. 

01:31 
there's gonna be a couple of things 

01:33 
The GPM and the views per video. 

01:35 
So once you're here, you can see this right here, 

01:37 
which is GPM, which is like the amount they generate 

01:40 
So anything over like, honestly, 

01:43 
that's like under like six, seven. 

01:46 
low single digits, it's usually not the greatest. 

01:47 
But like this, 30, 40 is crazy. 

01:50 
Then right here, you're gonna see his average video views. 

01:52 
8.4k is pretty solid anything over like 5k in my opinion is good for average video views those are 

01:57 
your two most important things right because you know how many views are getting and how much money 

01:59 
are they generating with those views right that's all you care about so those are the two main things 

02:02 
you want to look at and then you can also scroll down on their profile there and you'll get to the 

02:05 
bottom you'll see their videos so you can see all the videos they've done with products and you can 

02:07 
kind of look see if that's something you like i'm not usually too picky because like i said we're 

02:10 
kind of just spamming reaching out to a ton of creators but you can look at those if you want 

02:13 
and then um once you do that you're going to click there'll be a little message button right 

02:18 
here next invite you can message that creator and it'll take you to the message center right so this 

02:20 
is the messaging center here 

02:30 
And then you can send them a message. 

02:33 
So message templates right here. 

02:35 
These are the two main ones I'm using right now. 

02:36 
You guys can go ahead and steal these. 

02:38 
But, you know, we came across your TikToks and give you a perfect fit to showcase products, whatever. 

02:41 
Our blah, blah, blah product is designed to whatever. 

02:44 
You know, if it's like a skincare, it's like to make your skin more moisturized, blah, blah. 

02:47 
And then we're offering 20% commissions for every sale. 

02:50 
And it's easy as making a video and tagging our product. 

02:55 
This one we also say, you know, feel free to request a sample. 

02:58 
We'll get a free product shipped to you this week. 

02:59 
So that's a little bit different. 

03:03 
I wouldn't say one works, you know, noticeably better than the other. 

03:05 
But those are the templates for you guys to steal. 

03:07 
So once you send these, let's go back here. 

03:08 
Once you send these templates here and say they reply, like, yeah, we're interested, whatever. 

03:12 
Then what I do is click this little shop button here. 

03:14 
And you can just send them a preview of your product. 

03:17 
And they can request a sample directly from there. 

03:18 
Because what you want to do is, you know, with these, you're going to reach out to these creators. 

03:22 
And your goal is to get them to request a sample. 

03:24 
So once that sample is sent to them, they are obligated by TikTok to make a post with your product. 

03:28 
If they don't, they get their, like, TikTok shop, like, suspended or whatever. 

03:31 
So they can't even, they'll never be able to, you know, work with other products or anything like that. 

03:33 
So they really have to post your product. 

03:34 
So really the goal is just get people to request a sample from your shop. 

03:37 
Once they request, boom, you know, you'll get their order. 

03:40 
So that's kind of the name of the game right there. 

03:43 
So once you have some good examples from creators that made a good video, 

03:47 
it did well, got views, made sales, whatever, 

03:49 
you're going to want to start sending those good examples to new creators. 

03:51 
So once you have a creator that's going to post for you, 

03:52 
send them that good example so they have something to base it off of 

03:55 
Say, hey, make it pretty much like this. 

03:59 
That's going to be super helpful for performance on your videos. 

04:01 
Creators that do well, have them post again. 

04:04 
So if you have a creator and they post your product and it does really well, 

04:06 
ask them, hey, this generated us money. 

04:15 
So yeah, once you have this going, 

04:17 
you're going to notice creators will start reaching out to you, 

04:20 
And then you don't even have to reach out to creators anymore. 

04:22 
They will just request a sample from you and boom, you're ready to go. 

04:25 
You just have to accept their request and you're good to go. 

04:27 
So last thing here, you can run ads to these posts. 

04:31 
So say a creator posts about your product and it performs whatever you like it. 

04:35 
You can actually start running ads to that post and boosting it. 

04:37 
And that'll get you sales, 

04:38 
but also that'll put that video out there for other creators to see it. 

04:42 
So this is kind of how you get the ball rolling. 

04:44 
You don't get that snowball effect going. 

04:45 
You can kind of throw some money at it to speed this up. 

04:46 
So that's another option if you guys want to do that. 

04:48 
um okay next thing organic creators so i just broke down kind of the affiliate structure and 

04:52 
that's really where majority of tiktok shop money is being made right now just you know reaching out 

04:55 
to creators getting the post for you and you know generating sales but another thing you can do which 

04:59 
not a lot of people are on this i know a few people but you can have tons of different um 

05:03 
organic creators posting for you um connected to your shop so the thing with this is you are going 

05:07 
to need um these creators are going to either need 5 000 followers or they're going to create 

05:11 
their own tiktok shop account um themselves which that creating a tiktok shop account is 

05:14 
kind of a little bit of work so it's kind of hard to get these creators to do that but that is an 

05:17 
option otherwise they're gonna need 5 000 followers so what this would look like is say you have 

05:21 
five different tiktok accounts that are all under your brand name and they're all posted they're all 

05:25 
have one creator on each account and he's posting every single day you just pay that creator um you 

05:28 
know a monthly fee and now you have these five accounts new videos every day with your product 

05:31 
tag these can be the ai videos these can be simple videos these can be you know um storyline whatever 

05:35 
training stuff whatever you want um they can just be spamming posts with your product every day and 

05:38 
you know that's a whole other operation you can run as well separate from this uh the affiliate 

05:41 
strategy so that's basically it for this video guys um i think i hit on everything if you have 

05:45 
any other questions you know i'll be in the discord we have a tiktok shop channel now so you 

05:47 
questions in there and you know i'll keep you guys updated on my strategies i'm doing this now 

05:50 
i'm still in the early stages um so i'm just kind of learning as i go to here so i'm gonna be sharing 

05:54 
all my everything i learned with you guys as well so yeah hopefully that was helpful i'll see you 

06:01 
Thank you for watching.
