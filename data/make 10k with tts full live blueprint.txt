this is how you make your first $10,000 with TikTok shop live, even if you are a complete

00:32 
This is how you make your first $10,000 with TikTok shop live, even if you are a complete 

00:38 
beginner. So the first thing that you need to start is a TikTok shop affiliate account. 

00:43 
You can either grow one organically to 5,000 followers, or you can simply just buy an account. 

00:49 
To buy an account, go over to Discord, go to the collective, and scroll all the way down to where it says TikTok shop accounts. 

00:58 
Click that, and then you guys will be able to choose between a few. 

01:02 
supplies. 

01:04 
So after you have obtained an affiliate account, the next thing that you are going to need is a winning product. 

01:10 
To find a winning product, simply just go over to calodata.com, sign up with a 7-day free trial, and after that, go ahead and click on product on the top of your screen. 

01:22 
After you click product, this is going to show you the top 10 best-selling products on the TikTok shop right now. 

01:31 
Look through these products and choose whichever one you guys think you will do the best with. 

01:36 
So now that you have your winning product, you are going to need a winning script. 

01:40 
Go back over to CaloData, choose whichever product you are thinking about. 

01:44 
For example, this collagen peptide. 

01:47 
And after you guys click on it, scroll all the way down to where it says live. 

01:52 
This is going to show you the highest performing lives in terms of revenue in the past week or even the past 30 days. 

02:01 
So go through these top lives and see everything that these creators are saying, doing, the tonality that they're using, 

02:09 
the call to actions, the different facts, frequently asked questions, etc. 

02:14 
And you're going to take those and you're going to go ahead and put those on a Google Doc. 

02:18 
So this is what I've done for the collagen peptides. 

02:21 
Just a bunch of different facts about it. 

02:24 
a different 

02:25 
different facts about the different ingredients, benefits, and just a bunch of things to constantly 

02:31 
repeat. For example, the shipping is super fast. If you've been taking these, let me know your 

02:37 
experience in the comments to get more engagement. Okay, different facts about it, like it's great 

02:42 
for your hair, nails, skin, joints, etc. You just want to put all of these different facts 

02:47 
and frequently asked questions on a Google Doc, and this is what you're going to use for your 

02:53 
script. You're going to want to use these bullet points instead of a word-for-word script so you 

02:58 
don't sound robotic, but pretty much what you're going to do is just go to the top creators, 

03:02 
see what they're saying in these little snippets, and pretty much just copy their script. 

03:08 
Now, here are a few tips to avoid any suspensions or violations, okay? 

03:13 
So TikTok is very strict when it comes to any medical claims. 

03:17 
So if there's anything a doctor has to diagnose you with, don't say it. 

03:22 
For example, don't say anything about ADHD, anxiety. 

03:29 
Don't say anything about just any medical condition. 

03:32 
If you say it will cure anything, if you say your product will help with something, 

03:37 
then there's just a bunch of different things that you can say. 

03:40 
So make sure to look through TikTok's terms and services, 

03:43 
and you should be able to have a better understanding of that to avoid any suspensions or violations. 

03:49 
Here are extra tips to maximize your permission. 

03:53 
Tip number one is commission.
