00:03 
All right. What's up, guys? So this is the video about, you know, making videos and going viral, making sales with TikTok shop as an affiliate. 

00:14 
These are the key things I want to go over here, and then I'll go in, then we'll go ahead and look at some examples. 

00:20 
So number one, or first off, the videos that work best for TikTok shop affiliates are much different than like the typical organic videos, right? 

00:30 
So in the rest of this course, a lot of those principles we talk about in, you know, the content creation section and stuff like that don't really apply to this, right? 

00:40 
It's a very different thing, but it's also easier, too. 

00:43 
So you don't really need all that stuff to make these videos go viral. 

00:47 
So first of all, be a customer. 

00:50 
This is like probably one of the biggest things, and that's why they put it down first, is you're not some professional brand owner, like you're not an influencer. 

01:00 
You're just a normal person that bought this product, and you found it beneficial for your own life, right? 

01:06 
So now you're going to go on TikTok and share that to other people. 

01:10 
You just want to be a normal human, normal customer, and you want to come off as like the most like typical person ever, right? 

01:19 
Be relatable. 

01:20 
That's number two. 

01:21 
So it kind of plays into the first thing. 

01:23 
Be a normal person that all these people that, you know, work normal jobs, blah, blah, blah, they can relate to you, right? 

01:29 
Like, hey, I get home from work. 

01:31 
I have really low energy, no energy to do anything. 

01:34 
So I started taking this supplement, and now like I get home and I can do the dishes, right? 

01:39 
Like see how I kind of. 

01:41 
I'm being relatable. 

01:43 
Those are two very key things. 

01:45 
So next, quality over quantity. 

01:47 
Typically with, you know, TikTok organic and other things, it's usually like I would say quality over quantity, right? 

01:55 
Instead of posting a bunch of bad videos, just post one really good video. 

01:58 
But with this, it's kind of a little bit. 

02:01 
You kind of want to spam at least like three to four videos a day, right? 

02:04 
Because it's just different, right? 

02:06 
So that's one thing I'll say. 

02:10 
And number four. 

02:11 
So 60 seconds. 

02:14 
A lot of videos, which you'll notice with TikTok shop that do well are actually longer. 

02:18 
And I have no idea why this is. 

02:20 
I'm not really sure. 

02:21 
It's just something I've observed. 

02:22 
And a lot of my students and friends have seen this as well is whenever they have videos over one, one minute, they tend to do better. 

02:31 
So this does not say they need to be 60 seconds long. 

02:34 
I would definitely test some 10, 15 second videos as well. 

02:38 
But it's just something to keep in mind. 

02:40 
Showing your face helps. 

02:42 
So you don't need to show your face. 

02:43 
I know a lot of people crushing it, just not showing their face at all. 

02:47 
But if you show your face for one, it's going to make you more trustworthy. 

02:51 
So your sales will probably be better. 

02:53 
And for two, it makes a little bit more entertaining. 

02:55 
Right. 

02:56 
When you're making these simple type videos, giving someone a face and lips to like to look at and like, you know, your eyes, like it just gives something for people to look at. 

03:06 
And kind of keep their eyes entertained. 

03:08 
Number six. 

03:09 
Number six is talk about how it changed your life. 

03:11 
So like I was talking about, like problem, problem solving. 

03:16 
Like talk about what it's going to do, what it did for you and what it could do for other people. 

03:20 
So, hey, I started taking this product. 

03:22 
All of a sudden I woke up. 

03:25 
Like before my alarm clock even went off, I felt super energized, went to work, felt super, super happy. 

03:32 
My coworkers were saying, oh, my God, how did you get all this energy? 

03:34 
Like, you know, make it very relatable and real and like how it can change your life and how. 

03:40 
And then last thing, write a script ahead of time. 

03:42 
So this isn't necessary, but it's going to help you make more like concise and powerful videos. 

03:49 
So instead of just yapping about the product randomly, you can actually write down like, OK, here's my hook. 

03:56 
Don't take this product. 

03:57 
It will literally, you know, change your life. 

03:59 
And then it's like, OK, I started taking this and all of a sudden all my all my family members were asking, like, what's wrong with me? 

04:07 
Why are you like, are you on drugs or something? 

04:09 
Why are you just cleaning the house all day? 

04:11 
Like you can kind of script out this like perfect and very powerful, you know, almost like a customer testimonial is the closest thing I would say to it. 

04:21 
These are the type of videos. 

04:22 
So that's about it. 

04:24 
Now, let's take a look at some examples here so you can get a real idea of like the videos that are working right now. 

04:30 
OK, so first one here. 

04:33 
Actually, let's look at this one. 

04:39 
So this is kind of what I was just saying. 

04:42 
He this is the product I showed you guys in the last video. 

04:45 
But he's saying, like, do not buy these. 

04:47 
This is kind of his hook. 

05:09 
So. 

05:13 
So. 

05:23 
See exactly what I was talking about, like he's he's this video is literally perfect. 

05:28 
And what you'll notice is it's extremely long, right? 

05:32 
This is three and a half minutes long and it did extremely, extremely well. 

05:35 
So it's kind of following all the principles I was talking about. 

05:39 
you know you're welcome to go look at some of this guy's videos i'm not going to watch the 

05:42 
whole thing right now but um yeah he kind of just rambles on about all the things that's 

05:46 
changed for his life blah blah and i'm this video probably made him at least 20k profit 

05:53 
he took home like this kid made at least 20k off this probably more uh so let's look at another one 

06:00 
here all right so you know this video didn't do crazy good but i guarantee you this made him some 

06:24 
decent money just because this stuff converts like crazy but you can't tell me like 

06:30 
Anyone watching this right now, you can't make videos like this. 

06:32 
They're so low effort, so simple. 

06:36 
It's literally just a random person just talking about a product. 

06:39 
Like I was saying, you don't need any of the principles that I teach for TikTok organic, really. 

06:49 
A couple, like Good Hook, blah, blah. 

06:50 
But for the most part, it's so easy to make these videos. 

06:53 
All right, let's watch this last one. 

06:54 
This one's actually for Guru Nanda, which they print on TikTok shop. 

07:00 
This is a perfect video. 

07:15 
And yeah, he's got white teeth. 

07:20 
So the product, you know, right there, it sells the product. 

07:27 
That's it for this video. 

07:28 
Now, if you've watched my last couple of videos as well, you're all ready to go to start making money with TikTok shop as an affiliate. 

07:37 
I think this is the best opportunity.
