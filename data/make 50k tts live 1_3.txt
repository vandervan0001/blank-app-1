what's up everyone my name is sam i'm going to be going over some tiktok live sauce for you guys 

00:14 
how i did over 50k revenue in around three weeks just going on tiktok lives so this is everything 

00:20 
you need to know in order to cash out and just to rack up those commissions so let's get straight 

00:25 
into it the first thing what we're talking about is two ways to set up your tiktok live 

00:30 
um and these are the best two methods so the first method is just having the product in front 

00:35 
of your camera and just simply talking about it and we'll get into exactly what to talk about how 

00:39 
to set up what you should talk about and stuff like that and a few slides down but this is one 

00:46 
of the methods that you just put up your the product and you just talk over it and you have 

00:51 
one of these like um deals and free shippings and we'll get into all that but this is one of 

00:56 
the methods that you should look at this is great for people who 

01:00 
don't want to show their face on the content so if you're somebody who's really shy and they 

01:04 
don't want your face on the content then this is a perfect way to do it but the second method 

01:09 
is a method that i like to do personally because i think it builds a better trust with the viewer 

01:14 
and it's easier to convert with but you can do the first method and you can cash out i see people 

01:19 
doing 10k months in commission alone with the first method so don't think that like if you 

01:25 
don't do this specific method that you that you won't cash out but this is just a specific method 

01:31 
But just having your face in there and then having a little text of showing the specific deals, like 20%, 30% off, and also having amazing discounts right here. 

01:40 
And then just talking about the product and just having your face actually in the content because I think it builds more trust with the viewership in order for them to actually buy from you. 

01:48 
Because you're building a relationship that you wouldn't have if you don't show your face. 

01:52 
But either method is fine. 

01:54 
These are the two main methods. 

01:55 
But I would try and go for the method too. 

01:57 
But if you don't want to show your face, that's completely fine. 

01:59 
You will still cash out if you do some of these tips and basic advice I give you. 

02:07 
But let's go to the basics of doing TikTok Live. 

02:09 
So the basics is be a professional yapper. 

02:12 
Engage with chat 24-7. 

02:14 
Be personable and make friends in the chat. 

02:16 
And not 100% of all content has to be solely about the product. 

02:19 
So let's digest this. 

02:20 
So be a professional yapper. 

02:22 
I would not recommend lives to you if you cannot just speak off the top of your head. 

02:26 
You can speak about anything. 

02:27 
This is for people who are yappers. 

02:30 
And for people who constantly talk 24-7. 

02:32 
For me, that was something that was very easily. 

02:34 
I can talk about anything for hours on end. 

02:36 
So talking about a product that I'm actually passionate about and I actually use. 

02:41 
It's very easy to me. 

02:43 
engage with chat 24 7 so any comment that you have anytime somebody joins you live anytime 

02:49 
somebody likes a live or shares a live you want to be saying oh thank you for liking the live 

02:53 
thank you for sharing the live and then saying this name too so like that's one of the things 

02:58 
i'll be uh where people be like oh i can thanks for liking live guys it's like no the person who 

03:02 
liked you live make sure to say their name and get very personal with them because the more personal 

03:07 
that you're all with somebody the more they will stay longer and actually have um conversations 

03:11 
with you down the line and even if they're not going to buy a product that boosts engagement 

03:14 
over the long run so be personable so so like this is something that is hard for some people 

03:20 
honestly but be personable just act like your viewers are your friends and just talking to 

03:24 
your friends that's basically what that means what make friends in the chat and not 100 of all 

03:29 
convo has to be solely about the product so you can talk about how your day like not everything 

03:35 
has to be solely about the product talk about oh like how was your day guys like let me know how 

03:41 
and get to know these people and to make them want to come back to your life to help better 

03:46 
boost engagement if that makes sense so it doesn't have to be product product product 

03:50 
this is the product's benefits this is products but a lot it's like make friends with your chat 

03:55 
if they are commenting and then try and just make friends with the chat first and then this is 

04:00 
probably one of the most important things write down five to ten scripts that you'll be saying 

04:04 
on live on repeat until you get decent traction then you can go into more of a storytelling 

04:09 
setting so i want you guys to 

04:11 
write down on a notepad before you go live write down 10 benefits about the product and write down 

04:18 
10 things about the product that you see as unique that you see as kind of like oh wow like this 

04:22 
product has this that these other products don't have write down 10 things that you'll be saying 

04:27 
on repeat right and this is also with like obviously you'll be engaging with chat and 

04:32 
you'll be making friends in the chat whatever but you want to be saying these scripts over and over 

04:37 
again until you get a decent traction until you get people actually asking about the product 

04:41 
and then you can go into a more of a storytelling setting and with my advice with this is that you 

04:45 
want to storytell about somebody that is related to you or somebody like in your life that takes 

04:52 
the product and they put you on the product that makes sense so be like oh like and my mom has been 

04:57 
testing out this product for the longest time and it helped her with x y and z and then she 

05:02 
said hey sam like you should go and take this product and i didn't know uh like and i ended 

05:09 
see some of the great products you guys have got in store and we'll be um i'll be doing some of these 

05:10 
that she had all up it's like the different people that you bring into the conversation when it comes 

05:16 
to like them having benefits too and then you also like seeing that they had benefits and then you 

05:21 
giving a try that would make them want to take your word on it whether than just straight telling 

05:26 
the viewership of like oh like it changed my life so much it changed me x y and z it's like if they 

05:32 
hear it from you saying another person took it and had benefits then it's going to have a stronger 

05:37 
effect if that makes sense to you guys but if you have a second phone watch live and interact 

05:43 
with yourself so this isn't exactly like 100 necessary but it is something that you can do 

05:47 
to help just like grow your live and to help engagement is that if you do have a second phone 

05:51 
or a laptop which i used to do this on a laptop personally um i used to just watch my live in a 

05:57 
laptop so i would always have at least one viewer and that it would be getting the watch time and 

06:00 
the engagement and i'll be commenting to myself and then i'll be interacting with myself pretty 

06:05 
much until i build up a legitimate audience 

06:07 
if you don't have above 10 views in the first 10 minutes we start live and try again we'll go live 

06:16 
with a different account i went live with around five different accounts and i rotate consistently 

06:19 
so in my heyday i probably went live with around five different accounts if one account was dead 

06:24 
for a few hours or a few days i would just rotate to another account and it would usually be fine 

06:28 
but if you don't get above 10 views in the first 10 minutes and you're live 

06:33 
then something is wrong usually your first two to three minutes you're going to be live 

06:37 
you're going to get a huge amount of push to your live and if you don't then something may be wrong 

06:42 
don't take that as like oh like i need to restart my live every single time i don't have 10 views in 

06:47 
10 minutes that's not exactly what it means it just means that like if your live is at steady 

06:52 
one to two like one to three viewers for like an hour on end and there might be something wrong 

06:57 
with your account or it might just be a dead account but you can always try again and again 

07:01 
and i and i used to have dead accounts but then i used to like go back on them a few weeks later 

07:06 
and they used to be fine so it really just is is tiktok feeling the algorithm for you that day 

07:11 
so don't get discouraged if you do not get this just this is something to look at 

07:16 
and you are a marketer sell the product people buy from people they like so don't be a dick so 

07:22 
you are a marketer at the end of the day i said be professional 

07:25 
yapper and like engage with chat 24 7 but the thing 

07:29 
is like you want to be selling a product at the end of the day and and yes this stuff obviously 

07:36 
um is how you're going to build a community but in theory you want 

07:40 
the community to eventually buy so make sure you're selling the product and
