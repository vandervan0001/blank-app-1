00:02 
all right guys we are back with another video i'm here on notion because google 

00:14 
was tripping out google slides was tripping out for the 

00:18 
whole video examples so we're gonna make this work shouldn't be an issue but this one is titled 

00:24 
contrast this is one of my favorite new terms very similar to controversy another one that i 

00:31 
thought of and now you hear everyone talk about you will probably see this soon with contrast it's 

00:35 
another way of packing your videos packaging your videos in a very specific way that is engaging 

00:41 
consistently so you've seen how we've used controversy and emotion sparking to reverse 

00:46 
engineer engagement and help people up on tiktok but another vehicle to do the same 

00:50 
thing of emotion sparking is this contrast and it's something i realized semi-recently 

00:56 
Um, and thankfully it's exactly what it sounds like. 

00:59 
We're taking one situation, thing, object, person, and comparing it with a different 

01:03 
one, contrasting it with a different one. 

01:06 
And I started to realize when I was looking at some of these videos, like I was like, 

01:09 
you know, do it like this, do this video like this. 

01:12 
And I was like, what's, what am I really saying here? 

01:14 
What's the overarching word for this? 

01:16 
Kind of similar to how I realized the whole motion sparking thing is I was like, oh my 

01:20 
God, there's these videos very specific within those, the subcategory of contrast. 

01:25 
What I mean. 

01:26 
What I mean is like this, I'm just going to show you and you will see. 

01:33 
What people think when we sell lighters and they're showing a regular lighter. 

01:36 
Add a little bit of spice. 

01:44 
First, what we actually sell. 

01:46 
And if you're savvy enough, you'll know I already talked about this 

01:49 
in copying other people's content in this course. 

01:53 
So you don't want to copy this identically and be very careful of that. 

01:56 
That's not going to do you any good. 

01:57 
Like hundreds and hundreds of people have tried to do that to the same thing. 

02:01 
But take the principles of this, right? 

02:03 
They're comparing a basic lighter to a new one, right? 

02:08 
And it's giving you instant credibility that it's a better lighter. 

02:12 
Proving the point without having to say anything. 

02:14 
While being engaging, seeing the difference very clearly. 

02:17 
Has a cool product. 

02:18 
Hitting every fucking bar there. 

02:21 
Packaging a short TikTok. 

02:23 
There's tons of good trends out there always to use for contrast. 

02:27 
And your money. 

02:28 
Like, I don't have much more to say about this. 

02:30 
This is not rocket science. 

02:31 
It's just a very engaging style. 

02:34 
Add a little bit of spice. 

02:36 
You find a good trend that's going in your talk. 

02:39 
Contrasting one thing to another. 

02:40 
It's extremely engaging, guys. 

02:43 
You'll see this format a lot where it'll say what I sent or what I ordered and what I got. 

02:46 
What I sent to my manufacturer versus what I got. 

02:48 
What I planned versus what came out. 

02:50 
Contrast, contrast, contrast. 

03:01 
What I sent my manufacturer versus what I got. 

03:04 
By the process of it, you're like, okay, he's sending these mock-ups. 

03:12 
So, this isn't going to work for every product or whatever. 

03:15 
But a lot of you are going to be able to do this. 

03:16 
And, like, even personal brands, whatever. 

03:17 
Like, there's so many different ways you can package contrast. 

03:19 
And there's so many trends and sounds and audios to do it. 

03:21 
So, I want to make sure you guys keep this in your Rolodex and have it in, like, you know, your toolkit. 

03:25 
Because if you have a product that, you know, has some kind of transformation or is a huge improvement off a basic item that a lot of people know, whatever. 

03:34 
Really, really think about unique ways of packaging this. 

03:37 
It's very basic, honestly. 

03:38 
Like, you literally, it's what the word says, contrasting things. 

03:40 
And you'll start to see it more and more now. 

03:41 
It's not every video, but it's some of them. 

03:42 
Every video has an emotion spark, but not every single one has a contrast. 

03:45 
And now you can watch it in one form. 

03:48 
There's tons and tons and tons more out there. 

03:50 
It's a powerful strategy that works for a lot of things, but not everything. 

03:52 
So, keep it in your toolbox, like I said. 

03:54 
Just like controversy, emotion sparking. 

03:55 
We're just trying to get our bag deep. 

03:57 
And some of you guys will have perfect products for this. 

03:58 
For example, I had a kid in my discord the other day showing me light-up soccer balls, right? 

04:02 
Perfect example of a product that's improved from an original one. 

04:05 
Like, there's soccer balls, and then there's light-up soccer balls, right? 

04:08 
So, they were like, I helped him make a video where it was like, you know, I forgot exactly what he said in it. 

04:13 
But it was like what most people do when they play soccer at night. 

04:15 
And, you know, he had the soccer ball, and then it went out, and you couldn't see it. 

04:20 
Turned off the lights, and it was glowing. 

04:24 
You might be, like, doing a transformation for your personal brand. 

04:26 
You might be doing a transformation for your cleaning business. 

04:30 
I don't know who's watching this, what you bought this for. 

04:31 
But regardless, something that's very, very powerful, and you should keep in your books. 

04:45 
Cheers.
