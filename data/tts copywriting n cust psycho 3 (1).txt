00:01 
change because now you've gotten to them to the awareness level that you want and now you need to 

00:03 
incite action so this is where you get the persuasion tactics did you know that you can get 

00:06 
20 discount on our bills and we sell out so you need to get now and the deals ending and whatever 

00:08 
you know you can kind of stack all of those and most aware please try our product again they have 

00:12 
now tried your products and other products and at this point if they don't like your product you're 

00:15 
kind of screwed but if they don't like your product potentially you can say oh well we've 

00:17 
actually changed the formulation so try it again they do like your product well here's a discount 

00:20 
code i'll just put in front of their face i know you like that you want to buy another one so 

00:22 
you're persuading less and less as you go down because they've already tried the product you 

00:25 
see to put your product in front of them and it'll probably buy again if they've never tried 

00:27 
in the first place they don't know you exist you have to do more and more this is kind of 

00:29 
the brand versus direct response if someone's already fried coke i just need to show them an 

00:32 
ad if someone's smiling and drinking a coke and they'll probably buy so to exist i show a person 

00:36 
smiling and drinking something they're just gonna be confused it doesn't make sense so now how do 

00:39 
we apply this to copywriting so this is going to be very basic copywriting can go incredibly deep 

00:42 
but for your application i want you guys to think in modular frameworks what that means is rather 

00:46 
than thinking of like how i write this specific sentence what words do i use you're gonna break 

00:49 
everything down into a structure that you can repeat so the main structure that i think is 

00:52 
most effective that i've seen across tiktok shop is broken down into these parts the first section 

00:55 
is the hook the aim of this is to get their attention in the first three seconds 

00:57 
and you can use something called open loop where you just drop them into a story so for instance 

01:01 
someone might be talking oh boom so i was at this party and i was talking to this girl right but 

01:03 
then all of a sudden this thing happened blah blah so you started the video off just opening 

01:07 
with a story there's no hook that's saying stop please watch this look it's just it opens into 

01:09 
that it might be a girl doing her makeup and she just starts with so i was at the store the other 

01:12 
day and it's not a hook where it's super attention grabbing you're not you know lighting the banana 

01:15 
on fire you're not doing a crazy editing trick you're not having any visuals but you're dropping 

01:17 
them in and there's this peaking of interest this actually works really well for tiktok shop 

01:20 
because all these other ones are a little bit more aggressive now adjusting the camera i've 

01:22 
seen this as well where people will kind of bend down adjust their camera and that visual will kind 

01:25 
of change as they're talking maybe they're cutting something interesting maybe we have a unique 

01:27 
background that kind of gets more into the video side which will have a whole video on hooks but 

01:30 
on the copyright side can be with a story can start with a crazy thing about the problem if 

01:34 
you have anxiety you need to see this i solved my anxiety in two weeks here's how but the aim of that 

01:38 
is to get people to stop because nobody stops and they're not even going to watch the video in the 

01:40 
first place you don't get to the rest of this they don't stop next you kind of segue into the 

01:44 
problem so you need to introduce the problem which is then going to be solved by your product 

01:46 
and you can actually invert this with the negatives of the problem so the negatives of the problem are 

01:50 
going to be introduced a problem let's say i had high cortisol that's a problem that's like a high 

01:55 
negatives of that problem is that as a result of having high cortisol i was always moody as a 

01:57 
result of being moody my relationship with my wife was strained as a result of that and now i'm 

02:00 
getting a divorce so we started with a problem which is i had high cortisol but nobody knows 

02:04 
really what cortisol is or what it does yes it's a stress hormone does all this other stuff but 

02:07 
realistically nobody cares about hormones they care about they're getting divorced so they don't 

02:10 
want to solve their hormone problem they want to solve their wife divorcing them so the negatives 

02:12 
of the problem are ultimately what are going to get people to take action but you can flip this 

02:15 
in your script so you can make it believable at the start and just say oh if you're like me you're 

02:19 
always moody all the time and then you go deeper and say well even though you might be moody but 

02:22 
actually what happened to me is because i was always having these issues that me and my 

02:24 
wife started arguing and fighting whatever and now we're getting divorced and then you go back 

02:27 
into the problem and say well i did some research i discovered it was actually because i had high 

02:30 
cortisol so you start with the negative you start with the crazy thing oh i'm getting divorced next 

02:33 
week and it's all because of this crazy hormone so that's how you can put it into your script 

02:36 
that's just an example and then you want to get into a potential solution introduction so potential 

02:39 
solution meaning another product that isn't yours so this one you can just say i had tried xyz thing 

02:43 
in the past so i had tried this other weight loss pill i had tried this other thing but then you 

02:48 
introduce the negatives of the potential solutions i tried it but because if you tried it and it did 

02:51 
well why are you talking about this product you should be talking about that other one you should 

02:53 
be talking about the competitive but if you tried it and it did well why are you talking about this 

02:54 
but then it actually made the problem worse it solved my problem but actually had these other 

02:57 
side effects i didn't think about it had great reviews but what they don't tell you about it is 

03:00 
it does all these other things so i tried this other weight loss pill but it actually didn't 

03:03 
really work for me as a result i was asking my friends and then they introduced me to this product 

03:07 
and that's the product you're actually selling the reason this works so well is because rather 

03:09 
than just introducing the product you're including the other ones that people have tried so you're 

03:12 
closing the doors that other people could think because they could be thinking well this product 

03:14 
is cool but i could try all these other ones and you're already telling them no don't even try 

03:17 
those because i already did it and i'm gonna save you the time and money just use this one because 

03:19 
i've done the research again this is bringing back like i am the authority and because you have a 

03:22 
problem similar to them you have the unity of the liking the tribe and now you go into the product 

03:26 
introduction this one should be more fleshed out a natural discovery in line with your story 

03:29 
and it should be related to the customer which is where the customer research comes in so if you're 

03:32 
talking to an 18 year old girl going to college you might say well i saw how this girl put this 

03:35 
product on her story so then i tested it out and actually it's crazy and it solved all my problems 

03:38 
and now whatever my ex came back to me i got my ex back thanks to this product so if you want to 

03:43 
get your ex back you have to take this product as well that's why i'm making this tiktok and oh you 

03:45 
can actually find it in the tiktok shop so the product needs to then solve the problem again 

03:49 
people are buying this product for the benefits they're not buying the product to buy products 

03:52 
useless junk they want to solve they want to solve a problem so in the other example once my 

03:56 
cortisol was fixed i actually became the nicest person to be around then my ex-wife texted me 

03:59 
back now we're back together so i went from getting divorced and it was a nightmare then i 

04:01 
took this problem and now i took this product it changed my whole life and then you end with 

04:05 
urgency scarcity and try to maximize the quantity so you say well this problem i went through the 

04:09 
whole journey i opened with a hook then i introduced oh i have this problem then i 

04:12 
introduced all the negatives then i introduced here's all these potential solutions but there's 

04:15 
actually a negative with those solutions then i got introduced to this product and actually it 

04:17 
changed everything for me and solved all my problems and now this is why i'm making the 

04:20 
video and as a matter of fact it's in my tiktok shop 

04:22 
it's in my link in bio but be careful because they've sold out seven times before be careful 

04:25 
because there's a flash deal and i'm warning you about it because you're just like me i want you 

04:28 
to solve this problem too right and you like me and i like you and we're part of the same tribe 

04:31 
i'm the authority figure because i've done the research and i've tried it so i'm gonna help you 

04:33 
out so you better buy five of them before they sell out before the flash deal ends and then that 

04:37 
is how you take a person who's never heard of you before didn't even know they had the problem 

04:40 
never been this product within 60 seconds they go from a viewer to a buyer now if you want to 

04:44 
actually apply this i would take this framework and then take existing winning scripts from 

04:48 
calo data or fast moss and look to the calo data tutorial how to do that and then break them down 

04:51 
into the framework of that script 

04:52 
and then rewrite them for your product so take whatever that script was break down sentence by 

04:56 
sentence i'll show you how to do it in that tutorial and then rewrite that based on your 

05:09 
How to do research. Two things you need to research. Your customer and your content. How to research your customer. Another way to refer to them is your ideal viewer, target viewer, target audience. Who is going to be watching your content? What do they like? What don't they like? 

05:29 
What do or don't they want? What makes them happy, angry, emotional, etc. 

05:32 
them happy 

05:35 
What entertains them? 

05:37 
You essentially have to become them. 

05:40 
Really put yourself in their shoes. 

05:40 
Really put yourself in their shoes. 

05:43 
How do I research them? 

05:43 
How do I research them? 

05:44 
Amazon reviews. 

05:46 
Look at reviews of your product on Amazon, as well as products similar to the one you are sending. 

05:52 
Reddit, look up threads, stories.
