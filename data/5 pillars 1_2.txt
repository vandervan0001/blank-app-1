The six sacred pillars to converting on TikTok by yours truly. 

00:10 
Guys, this is my secret sauce. 

00:12 
The stuff people will try to learn but never understand. 

00:15 
And I want to guide you guys through the motherfucking glory land. 

00:17 
If there's one that I say, really take notes on into this one because you're going to really want to make a checklist out of this shit. 

00:22 
So this is the sacred six. 

00:23 
This is something I have learned through doing hundreds of millions of views and watching all of you students. 

00:27 
Convert and not convert, right? 

00:29 
And this is the funnel and steps that go into the videos that convert and don't convert. 

00:31 
Right here, the sacred six. 

00:32 
Product context, call to action, trust your website, and country audience. 

00:35 
I can do this with my eyes closed, guys. 

00:36 
You got product context, CTA, trust, website, country, audience. 

00:39 
I can do it because I've locked this into my mind so hard. 

00:42 
I could have done that at the start. 

00:43 
I just did it after because fuck it, I don't know why. 

00:44 
But anyways, we're going to dive into every single one of these and basically all the stuff you guys need to know. 

00:47 
There'll be more stuff that you'll learn with experience, of course, but you want to make sure you really understand the fundamentals. 

00:50 
If you don't, ask questions, okay? 

00:52 
So products. 

00:52 
You guys know we've already been through the product stuff a lot, but it's very important to touch on because your product is usually your biggest lever for content and sales. 

00:56 
It can also be the biggest scapegoat. 

00:57 
And sometimes people just say they need to change their product, but really they just need to change other aspects like their context, CTAs, trust, et cetera. 

01:01 
But a lot of products do not have fucking demand, okay? 

01:04 
If you sell gimmicky-ass, dumb-ass products like stress pens or saturated products or weird decorations, like weird products or too saturated products, you're done, though. 

01:11 
No matter the efforts you do, it's going to be too late. 

01:12 
Like, for example, the little dumb-ass dorm room pots for cooking ramen, dead. 

01:15 
LED lights, soul set lamps, dead. 

01:17 
Makeup brush things, dead. 

01:18 
All the ones that we talk about saturated products, done. 

01:20 
Or products that have no intrinsic actual demand, right? 

01:23 
Like we also talked about the products. 

01:23 
All this stuff's in the products video, guys, but I'm going to say it because I'm going to cement it twice for you guys. 

01:26 
Like the USA ice tray is trash. 

01:29 
That kind of stuff. 

01:30 
You have to make sure you sell products with real demand, okay? 

01:32 
Real demand is going to bring you the real money, okay? 

01:34 
So make sure to use the product checklist and characteristic videos we gave you all, and it should help a lot. 

01:37 
But I just want to make sure you guys understand this so you get the funnel. 

01:38 
The first thing is the fucking product, right? 

01:40 
After that, goes your content. 

01:41 
And with your content, it's context. 

01:42 
This is like one of the biggest killers of conversions that I see. 

01:44 
A lot of you guys who have been around me for a while on content and stuff like that know that this is what I talk about a lot. 

01:48 
I also want to get the most questions on, so we're going to talk about some examples in a second. 

01:50 
But providing context that you are actually selling the product and that this product is yours and that there's a place to buy it is very, very, very, very important, guys. 

01:55 
You can't just flash your product and expect to get sales or just add on, link it in bio or whatever and get sales. 

01:59 
That's just not how it works. 

01:59 
You can't have your dick hanging in the background and that's why you get views and then expect to get sales, right? 

02:02 
This is something people don't realize, right? 

02:03 
Every million views is not built the same, okay? 

02:06 
Every million views is not built the same. 

02:07 
And how you change that is your context. 

02:09 
And your product, of course, matters too. 

02:11 
So we're not just trying to make some mean content for consumption.
