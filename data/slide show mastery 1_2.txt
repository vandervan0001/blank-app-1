00:01 
So what's up y'all, I'm Nick Fine, and if you're just getting into flight shows for the very first time, this is everything you're going to need to know. 

00:06 
So first of all, we have the mindset. 

00:08 
You just got to be willing to put in the work every single day, 

00:10 
no matter what, if you're seeing progress, if you're not. 

00:12 
Trust me, you're going to win in the end. 

00:14 
You just keep showing up every single day. 

00:17 
But eventually, you're going to get that first big slide show. 

00:20 
So just keep showing up every day. 

00:21 
Also, we have the brand account reviews. 

00:23 
So this is where your coach is going to go live. 

00:26 
He's basically going to give you live feedback on what you can do better 

00:28 
So if you're a beginner, there's no reason why you shouldn't be showing up to those. 

00:29 
you're a beginner. 

00:31 
And then next thing, we have the 200 views. 

00:33 
So if you keep making a new account saying, oh, my content is good, 

00:36 
my account is bad, you're never going to make progress. 

00:38 
The quicker you accept that if you're getting 200 views, your content sucks, and you need to make it better, the quicker you're going to get better. 

00:43 
So I think back in May, I made like four or five new accounts because I was like, oh, I have a bad account. 

00:47 
And then I started accepting, okay, my content sucks. 

00:50 
Then all of a sudden, next month, I had a million views. 

00:52 
And then finally, the more times you post, the more chances you have to go viral. 

00:55 
So say your friend is posting 30 times a month between four accounts. 

00:58 
You're posting 120 times a month through a four account. 

01:01 
Who do you think is going to get more practice and go viral in the end? 

01:03 
So it's really a reps game. 

01:04 
The more practice, the better you're going to get, and the more chances you have to go viral. 

01:07 
So just keep showing up, keep putting in the work, and outwork the person next to you. 

01:10 
So next, we have the basics of every good slideshow you're going to see on TikTok. 

01:13 
So the first thing, all your slides should be in the 3-4 ratio. 

01:15 
So when you're going to make them, when you go to the crop, you should see that little 3-4 right there. 

01:19 
You should make sure all your slides are in that format right there. 

01:22 
And then so secondly, the hook is basically going to be the reason why your slide goes viral or flops. 

01:25 
So if you have a bad hook, nobody's going to care about your bad slides. 

01:29 
You have to make sure you have a good hook. 

01:33 
I normally get mine from Pinterest. 

01:34 
I know some people are really good with AI and do mid-journey. 

01:37 
But easiest to get started with, you just search, like, say you want a Japan image. 

01:40 
You do Japan, then aesthetic. 

01:44 
Then it comes up with realistic-looking images of Japan for you to go in and pick out. 

01:47 
And then say you want this one right here. 

01:49 
You go in and tap on it. 

01:51 
And then you hit download image. 

01:53 
So then that's going to be your camera roll. 

01:57 
And then you want to screenshot that image. 

01:58 
If you don't do that, it'll show a blur in the slideshow, and you don't want that. 

02:01 
So once it's in your camera roll, go ahead and screenshot that. 

02:05 
And then next, so the CTL. 

02:07 
You want to make sure they're kind of hidden. 

02:08 
You don't want to be like, buy it now on Amazon or get this, please, or buy it now or come after. 

02:12 
You just make it, like, kind of hidden. 

02:13 
Otherwise, people are going to be in your comments saying add AI bot, add account. 

02:19 
And then finally, with your sounds, you want to make sure it fits your slideshow's length. 

02:22 
Say I'm making a Japan slideshow right here. 

02:24 
Guy in Japan, and it's a peaceful slideshow. 

02:25 
You don't want it to be like a rap music. 

02:26 
You want it to be peaceful, so I turn my volume. 

02:30 
It should sound kind of like that. 

02:31 
So you want to make it fit your slideshow. 

02:34 
This is probably the most important part of the whole slideshow game besides the mindset. 

02:37 
So you want to keep 80% of the slideshow that already popped off when it went viral and change 20% of it. 

02:41 
So say we have a my dad divorced my mom, so we went to Japan. 

02:44 
We want to do my mom divorced my dad, so we went to Italy. 

02:46 
And kind of keep the same idea of the hook, but switch it up a little bit. 

02:48 
And then say the body slides for the leaf forest and grocery stores. 

02:51 
You want it to do like cops and supermarkets. 

02:54 
And kind of keep similar text, but make it a little different. 

02:56 
So you want to keep the same idea of the slideshow, but change it a tiny bit. 

02:59 
And then secondly, the images you choose to 80-20, it should not look like a stock image. 

03:02 
It should look like you took it on your iPhone, so it should look really organic. 

03:05 
Because stock photos just don't do well for some reason. 

03:07 
And then finally, concurrency is really important. 

03:09 
So you shouldn't have a hook, and then have three pieces of text on one slide, 

03:12 
then two on the next, and six on the next, and one on the last one. 

03:14 
It should look the same throughout all of them. 

03:16 
I'll play a great example of 80-20. 

03:18 
This is my same account, two different posts. 

03:20 
They're the same idea, but I changed the second one a tad bit. 

03:22 
So I'm going to play the first one for you guys. 

03:24 
I did Italy with Shock, Tows, Guinea, everyone was. 

03:26 
Here's what Italy does different than the USA. 

03:28 
This one got 3.6 million. 

03:48 
And then this is my call-in soon. 

03:51 
I'm going to put this right here on my phone. 

03:53 
I probably should have hit that a little bit more if it worked. 

03:55 
Hey 

03:55 
This is still kind of disguised, but then we go to this slide show right here. 

03:59 
So we used, after working as an intern in Japan, so it's the same idea of shock, how skinny everyone was, here's everything Japan does differently, but you're taking the hook and changing it ever so slightly. 

04:07 
Then we go to the body slides right here. For example, this is kind of maintaining the same style, but a little bit different, because we have Japan, we're going to the USA, we have Japan stores, USA stores, and I changed some of the other body slides as well. 

04:19 
And the call to action was the same exact thing. So you basically, say you're 20, you change the slideshow just a tiny bit, like a new country or a new hook, and it's going to pop off. So that's the 820. 

04:29 
This is my two favorite ways to find inspo. So first, we have the burner account. This is where you make a new TikTok account, you're not going to post on there or anything, you basically just follow the good slideshow account, like you follow 20 or 31 that are already popping off. 

04:38 
And then you go to your free page, and it'll be just full of all really good slideshows. And then slideshows that's in the past seven days that are killing it, popping off, you want to get 8020 of those, because they're recent, they're updated, and they're going to be trending. You want to 8020 the stuff within the past week. 

04:50 
And then secondly, we have content inspo. So when you're like in a branded discord, they send content to the inspo channel, it'll basically be free stuff for you to copy in 8020 that's already working, and the coaches are going to send that in there. 

04:59 
I'm going to go over a slide and why it works so well. This one's by Les, you guys have probably all seen this one, it's simply really good. So it was the Japan slideshow, it was everything I noticed between Japan and USA. 

05:07 
So for a reason, it popped off, because nobody's done this before, he was the first one to do this. So we have, yeah, nobody's ever done this before, and his images also look super, super organic, like we can go through them. 

05:16 
This looks like you're at a Japanese restaurant, like this looks like I pulled out my phone and I took this out of a restaurant. 

05:20 
Then we also have his thrifting, this again looks like you're in Japan thrifting. We also have fashion, this looks like a Japan street. 

05:29 
Water quality. And look, so this is his setup to the call to action, you would not expect an ad coming, like each hotel in Japan had water filters, Mac was gone in a week. 

05:35 
So it was talking about the product without even making it an ad. And then finally we have, it was, ended up buying this whole church out of my head just to realize it's on Amazon, no more acne for me. 

05:43 
So he kind of disguises it in there and like says it's on Amazon and people didn't even realize it was an ad. 

05:47 
So he went and set it up right there, and then made the ad right there. 

05:51 
So this one, just overall super great slideshow, perfect images, and he was original with it. 

05:57 
Another example of a fantastic slideshow was this one. 

05:59 
This one is done by Evan, he's my friend. He made this two days ago, I think, it already is 1.2 mil. 

06:02 
So he took the regular Japan slideshow right here, where people talk about nightlife, clubbing and all that stuff, and took it to a whole new level. 

06:10 
So, we have Japan. 

06:12 
And then, that's like, I've not seen that before. 

06:14 
And like, it was kind of out of pocket, but like, if you keep going, like the comments he got was insane. 

06:19 
And we got 234,000 likes for 1.2 million views, and that's like a 20 or 25% like ratio, which is insane. 

06:26 
And yeah, so his slides, super unique. 

06:28 
Nobody's seen this before, and why he popped off. 

06:30 
And then on the comments now, scroll down, like, his comments, like, you don't have a single one on that. 

06:35 
Like, it's just all humor, there's no ad bot, any of that stuff, so that's why he popped off so hard. 

06:41 
And then for a little more info on the Twitter video, so it's easier content, just sucks, you need to make better content, and just focus on finding slideshows and 80-20ing those, or if you're using the exact same hook over and over and over again, that can also cause it. 

06:50 
Like, say, you're doing this Japan slideshow, but you're using bar for bar, like, everything I did wrong in Japan, dot dot dot, flag, use that exact same thing over and over again, it will not go viral. 

07:00 
And then, so, how do you break out? 

07:01 
Just make sure content's good, make sure the image ratio is 3 to 4 on par, use organic looking images, don't use stock images. 

07:07 
You want to look at what's working and what's not. 

07:09 
And then the account reviews are really helpful. 

07:11 
And then the chat sheet, that's underrated. 

07:13 
You can give it stuff like, put your quote or prompt or whatever, and then say make 10 that are similar, but unique, just stuff like that, and it can give you some pretty cool ideas. 

07:20 
And like, when your slide goes viral, I mean, it's really cool, but there's still more work to do. 

07:23 
So, when your slide goes viral, you don't want to use the same thing over and over and over again, because once it hits, it's not going to hit again. 

07:30 
But fortunately, you did find a style that works well in your account. 

07:32 
So make sure to 80-20 the crap out of that. 

07:34 
Like whatever worked, keep hammering that. 

07:37 
And then eventually, it will start to slow down. 

07:38 
And that's when you have to go in and do a whole new style. 

07:40 
So after you go viral, change up the one that worked until it doesn't work anymore. 

07:43 
And then go for a new style. 

07:45 
And then also, just don't get satisfied. 

07:47 
Because people could be one-hit wonders. 

07:49 
If they do one good slideshow, it's like, all right, I'm done. 

07:53 
Then finally, just show up to account reviews and do everything you can to get better. 

07:58 
It's basically free views where you...
