00:02 
No, no, no, no, no, cheese, cheese, cheese. 

00:15 
You 

00:16 
It should just be a couple minutes long. 

00:17 
I just want to give you guys a quick overview, 

00:20 
and then I'm going to talk about the reposting master class in a second. 

00:20 
Oh, no. 

00:25 
reposting what it is all it is is a brand has content and they want you to make a new account 

00:30 
and repost it to instagram facebook whatever all you're doing is literally copying a link 

00:32 
All you're doing. 

00:34 
downloading the video and reposting it 

00:38 
It's really just clicking a couple of buttons. 

00:40 
So it's literally like the easiest money of your life. 

00:45 
You will never make easier. 

00:46 
and the other thing about this is 

00:48 
you can make money on day one 

00:50 
so if you're watching this it's because you're in the discord 

00:52 
and if you're in the discord 

00:54 
you can literally make 

00:54 
really make 

00:56 
you can literally go make 50 to a hundred bucks right now. 

00:59 
All you do is go to the opportunities channel and there's always like new 

01:05 
You can find reposting deals and make some money. 

01:08 
So you can pay for your discord membership literally within like 30 minutes 

01:13 
it's a no brain, 

01:14 
but third thing. 

01:17 
It just takes a few minutes a day. 

01:19 
So it's not like this is some new extra side hustle that you have to spend a 

01:23 
bunch of time on or like, 

01:25 
Like it's literally just five to 10 minutes a day. 

01:28 
You can repost for multiple clients and make some extra. 

01:33 
I don't know why. 

01:35 
You wouldn't, especially as a beginner. 

01:36 
So other thing is there is also huge upside potential, right? 

01:39 
So huge. 

01:41 
So recently I was talking to a guy. 

01:44 
And this kind of, like, opened my mind to this, too. 

01:46 
Like, this dude made over. 

01:50 
we're 20k in a month from reposting right and before that i had heard of a couple people making 

01:58 
like five eight k in a month um but yeah i just heard of a guy that did 20k like that is the 

02:05 
upside potential of this right it could just be a little extra a few hundred bucks a month 

02:08 
or it could be like you know if you go viral you you can make an extra 10 20k in a month which is 

02:16 
absolutely nuts for spending a few minutes a day right like it's it's a no-brainer but 

02:34 
Thank you for watching. 

02:46 
Yes, because that's the other thing, when you work with these clients, you'll get paid a little up front. 

02:54 
First, I'm going to reveal the two winners. 

02:57 
Three, two, one. 

03:01 
I love you, mama. 

03:05 
$50, $100, and then you will. 

03:10 
Most of the time, you'll also get, like, commission deals, right? 

03:12 
So, like, percentage of the sales you make or a performance based on the views. 

03:16 
So, say you get 2 million views, maybe they pay you 500 bucks for every million views or something like that. 

03:22 
That's something you can work out with the client. 

03:25 
But, yeah, so there's massive upside potential. 

03:28 
And then, yeah, last thing, anyone can do it. 

03:30 
Like, literally, U.S.-based, not U.S.-based, you can use a VPN. 

03:36 
It takes zero skill, like literally anyone could do it. 

03:40 
You can't tell me, oh, I don't have enough time to do this because it literally takes 

03:43 
I know you have five, 10 minutes every day. 

03:45 
So that's basically it for this video. 

03:47 
Um, this, what I want you to do now, uh, if you're 

03:59 
Oh, it's already written in Japanese. 

04:04 
you're still interested in reposting is go watch this video this guy because i don't repost myself 

04:09 
right i actually hire i i have a bunch of reposters hired but you know i don't repost myself 

04:14 
so this is a guy that actually reposts and made good money doing it um i think he made like up 

04:20 
up to like two grand a month that is uh when he was kind of doing it like more full time but 

04:25 
he breaks it all down here guys so i know this video is quick and i didn't explain it that 

04:30 
I'm going to have to kill you guys. 

04:42 
Well, it is good. 

04:42 
Yeah, I did it. 

04:53 
Well, this guy literally breaks every part of it down, like what to charge, how to get clients, blah, blah, blah, everything, how to do it, reposting, he shows you exactly. 

05:03 
So 

05:05 
I'm going to call it the reposting masterclass because that's basically what it is. 

05:19 
He shares everything. 

05:20 
So go watch this video and you guys will be set. 

05:33 
No, I'm not going to do it. 

05:36 
Oh, I'm going to do it. 

05:39 
What do you want? 

05:41 
I want to go to school. 

05:43 
I want to go to school. 

05:50 
and you will literally have no more questions, I promise. 

05:53 
So peace out, guys. 

05:56 
See you in the next video. 

06:12 
That's a little reposting sauce. 

06:14 
This stuff is pretty simple. 

06:16 
But when I was reposting, you'd be surprised how many DMs I still got from...
