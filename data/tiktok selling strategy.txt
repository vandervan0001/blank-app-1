Yo, what's up guys? So this is a video. So you guys have been waiting for, um, kind of my updated 

00:09 
strategy on TikTok shop, a bunch of things I've learned. So let's get into it. Um, quick disclaimer 

00:16 
capital. So, you know, I've learned, you know, I've been learning some things and testing with 

00:21 
TikTok shop over the last couple of months. And honestly, I would say don't look into TikTok shop 

00:25 
as a seller, unless you have like 20 K in the bank. Honestly, if you have under 20 K, I wouldn't 

00:28 
even waste your time with it. Um, it's probably not going to be worth it. And we'll talk more 

00:31 
about that in a minute, but the other thing is like exception. So the thing I'm gonna talk about 

00:34 
in this video, there's always going to be exceptions to the rule or the criteria that I 

00:38 
said, right? So if I say, you know, these types of products are what you want to do on TikTok shop, 

00:40 
they're like low ticket products. It doesn't mean that high ticket products can't work. Um, 

00:43 
cause I have seen some high ticket products work on TikTok shop, but it's just like, that's a 

00:45 
minority. So I'm gonna be talking about the majority, right? Because that's really what 

00:47 
you want to aim for because that's like what's working the most. Right. So anyways, let's get 

00:50 
into it. Number one, product selection. 

00:51 
probably the most important part. So what I've learned with TikTok shop is it is very different 

00:55 
than anything else. The criteria you might have for a product for TikTok organic, for Facebook ads, 

00:59 
TikTok ads, or whatever else doesn't really apply exactly to TikTok shop. I would say the closest 

01:03 
thing to TikTok shop is actually Amazon. So these are a couple of things. One, you want it low 

01:08 
ticket. You want it preferably, you want under 40 for sure. And preferably, honestly, under 30. 

01:12 
The way people look at TikTok shop is a lot like Amazon in the way that they're really looking at 

01:15 
getting that product or whatever it is for a cheap price, like getting a good deal, getting a cheap 

01:19 
price. That's just how TikTok shop has created itself. And that's what people look for. So you 

01:23 
want low ticket stuff. You'll notice, you could have a $30 product, $40 product, and you'll still 

01:26 
see tons of comments about people complaining about the price. 

01:28 
it's just tiktok shop buyers are just super super cheap so yep low ticket that's number one um the 

01:33 
second thing is you kind of want you know the biggest niches are beauty and like supplements 

01:39 
like health right and women's clothing is also in there but i just ignore that one because i know 

01:42 
nothing about that you should never bother with it but beauty and supplements are basically the 

01:44 
two biggest ones that you know i kind of focus on so beauty you know skincare products like you know 

01:48 
how this you know the snail mucus one or whatever it's called that product absolutely crushed it's 

01:52 
one of the biggest ones but it's basically like you know you have acne or you have bad skin here's 

01:55 
this product and it's you know what people use in korea and they have really nice skin take this 

01:58 
product and your skin will get better right it's a problem solving simple simple thing there so 

02:01 
same thing with health right so it's like okay you have low testosterone take this or you have 

02:04 
bad health take sea moss you know that's a big product it's like these kind of just like shortcut 

02:06 
problem solving products are really what work and the other thing i would say with that is like 

02:10 
the shortcut right like you the products that work best with tiktok shop are the shortcut products 

02:13 
right so it's like take like this you have bad sleep you know here's this now you'll better sleep 

02:18 
like it's that simple right and maybe you can explain a little bit about the science behind it 

02:20 
but it's very like boom boom right it's not like some long exercise or workout or you know anything 

02:24 
like these people are just think about them as lazy as possible and they just want to quick fix 

02:28 
can give them that quick fix um and maybe there's some actual backing science to it that's that's 

02:31 
really where the money is i think you know so beauty it's like like i said it's the skincare 

02:34 
or like the hair product the salt spray or you know the supplements the sea moss the blah blah 

02:38 
blah that you know whatever it's gonna fix your testosterone overnight it's gonna fix your sleep 

02:41 
all these types these are the shortcut products man this is what really seems to work on tiktok 

02:44 
shop so yeah i would say those two things you know low ticket problem solving shortcut and then 

02:47 
anything else on product selection i wanted to mention here um yeah i would say that's it for 

02:53 
now um i think there was a third thing but i can't think of it so let's just move on for now 

02:55 
so inventory and fulfillment right so 

02:57 
I mentioned having capital because with TikTok shop, yes, there are some people that can get away with dropshipping or whatever. 

03:05 
There are some people that can get away with it, but eventually, the majority of the time, you're going to end up getting banned or having some refund issues. 

03:12 
Just go do TikTok organic. 

03:13 
Go do TikTok ads or become a TikTok shop affiliate or something. 

03:17 
You're probably better off just not touching dropshipping with TikTok shop. 

03:19 
With TikTok shop, you want to get inventory into the U.S. 

03:22 
You can ship it out yourself from your house, or what I do, send it to a 3PL, third-party logistics warehouse, and they'll do all the shipping for you. 

03:28 
I order inventory from China and put it into a 3PL warehouse here in the United States, and then all my products ship from there, so I have quick three- to five-day shipping. 

03:36 
That's really what you need with TikTok shop because it's super, super strict. 

03:38 
If you have a product that isn't shipped out within a certain amount of days, which it is changing sometimes, then it'll just automatically cancel and refund the customer. 

03:43 
Eventually, you get some strikes, and you'll just get banned. 

03:45 
Then once you get banned on there, it can be kind of a pain in the ass to get another account. 

03:48 
Then in the future, now you want to do it the right way, and you're banned. 

03:51 
It's just not really worth it unless you can buy inventory and get it into the U.S., ship it yourself, or at a warehouse and get fast shipping. 

03:56 
That's the way you're going to want to do a TikTok shop, honestly, guys. 

03:59 
I learned quite a bit doing some outreach because all my TikTok shop sales are just from affiliates. 

04:04 
On TikTok shop, there's a video on this, and of course, you go to the affiliate center, and you reach out to people there. 

04:07 
I don't do it myself because it takes a long time to send all these individual messages to a bunch of people. 

04:11 
I just hire a VA, pay them $5, $10 an hour, and they will just spam messages every day. 

04:14 
Right now, my VA is doing like 200, 300 messages a day, I think. 

04:17 
I just say, message whoever. 

04:19 
I'm not picky about the niche because really, TikTok shop is just like, man, it's just the Wild West. 

04:22 
You could have some random kid just in his room say, hey, go buy this product, and it might get 2 million views. 

04:27 
It might generate 200,000 sales. 

04:28 
It's really Wild West, so just get it to as many affiliates as possible. 

04:31 
If you have the product selection, which is why it's really important, if you have the product selection down and you have a good product, it'll snowball. 

04:36 
Eventually, you don't even have to reach out anymore. 

04:37 
It's just affiliates on affiliates will keep posting because they see other people posting and making sales, and they'll start posting. 

04:40 
It's just like a snowball that will just go off on its own. 

04:42 
Look at Guru Nanda or the snail thing. 

04:45 
The affiliates are just snowballing and posting because they're trying to make money. 

04:48 
These affiliates are looking for products to repost so they can make money. 

04:52 
I think I kind of mentioned everything I've learned recently. 

04:54 
And this is, TikTok shop's crazy, guys. 

04:57 
I just hit a 10K day, having some inventory issues now, but can easily get back to, I 

05:00 
think, 10K a day and do it pretty consistently. 

05:03 
Just because, like, that was from one post, from one influencer with, like, 40,000 followers 

05:08 
So that's it, guys. 

05:21 
Peace out.
