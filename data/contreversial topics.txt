00:00 
I was obsessed and I have the impression that the word is weak by a man to whom I caused a lot of harm that I persecuted for almost three years. 

00:14 
Yo, what's up boys? So, I dropped this thread on Twitter the other day. Didn't get that much love. I kind of honestly figured it wouldn't. Whenever I drop something on Twitter, that's like, I'll make... 

00:28 
10k in 30 days it blows up, but whenever I like 

00:30 
go in depth on a certain tactic um it never seems to really get too much love so you know i kind of 

00:35 
expected it but anyways i want to kind of go back into this and uh kind of break it down on a little 

00:39 
bit of a deeper level because i feel like this is a really powerful thread and really powerful 

00:42 
concept that if you really understand this and how to use it you will uh you'll have a lot of 

00:45 
success on tiktok um so yeah i'm basically just going to go into controversy i'll go over this 

00:49 
thread with you guys and hopefully you find this helpful so let's get into it so yeah this is just 

00:52 
a thread i wrote about um getting not using old controversy anymore and using kind of this new 

00:55 
age way of controversy so first let's take a look at the example what you shouldn't be doing 

00:59 
you 

01:04 
so yeah it says why don't you have an lgbtq discount on your site 

01:07 
and then they just respond shut the fuck up so it's like this video did you know 

01:13 
So you can see how this controversy works for views, 

01:15 
but you can imagine that this isn't going to sell very well. 

01:17 
It's going to bring a lot of hate and bad publicity to your brand. 

01:20 
So it's obviously not something you want to do, 

01:23 
because they're probably going to be pretty upset with you 

01:25 
for kind of making the brand look bad. 

01:26 
But yeah, so a few other examples would be like my wife's boyfriend, 

01:29 
which it's funny because I'm shitting on this now, 

01:30 
but I was literally the creator of this concept. 

01:32 
Like I dropped this hook, my wife's boyfriend, 

01:34 
and it blew, ended up, everyone ended up using it on TikTok 

01:36 
and doing really well with it. 

01:36 
But yeah, so like the My Steps sister stuff, 

01:37 
like all this stuff, I used to do this, 

01:39 
and it used to be a really good, like really smart way to go about it, 

01:41 
but now I'm finding there's better ways to do this. 

01:44 
Yeah, so I like to call it the New Age Controversy. 

01:45 
The goal is still the same. 

01:46 
Try to spark strong emotions in people 

01:47 
that cause them to react, comment, be shocked, blah, blah, blah. 

01:50 
and there's honestly more than just these three. 

01:53 
Stupidity, absurdity, and confusion, right? 

01:55 
So these are the three examples I have here 

01:58 
Not like the bad example, not with some weird, 

02:00 
not on some weird inappropriate shit. 

02:01 
So example number one, stupidity. 

02:07 
Yeah, so look how easy, like how simple that was. 

02:11 
It did like 14 mil or something views, something like that. 

02:13 
So all he did was answer, 

02:16 
He answered, no, you don't need to charge it, 

02:17 
but you need to charge that night, right? 

02:19 
but you see how that's going to make people go like, 

02:23 
And it obviously brings a lot of comments, 18,000 comments, 

02:25 
and it gets people to watch this probably, 

02:26 
people are watching this two to three times, 

02:29 
And yeah, that's a really good example of stupidity. 

02:33 
Like say you have a lamp, you're selling a lamp. 

02:34 
Someone asks, or even you put a fake comment on your profile 

02:36 
that says like, do I need to plug it in? 

02:56 
If you want it to be on, you plug it in, 

02:58 
You can use this concept across a lot of different products 

03:02 
blatantly saying something that makes no sense, you know? 

03:04 
So that's example one, a really good example. 

03:05 
So example two, let's watch this absurdity. 

03:11 
All they're doing is putting a female product 

03:12 
that is typically used on females, 

03:15 
and they're putting on a man, right? 

03:17 
you're just going against the grain. 

03:18 
You're going against what's normal, 

03:20 
and you're doing the opposite of it. 

03:21 
And that's always gonna kind of like 

03:22 
spark a little thing in people's brain, right? 

03:23 
Whenever you do the thing that's not expected, 

03:24 
it's gonna spark a little bit in people's brain. 

03:31 
And that's what I call absurdity, right? 

03:32 
You're just doing something kind of, 

03:34 
absurdity might not even be the greatest word for that, 

03:35 
so it's kind of what came to mind. 

03:37 
But you're really just going against the norm, 

03:38 
doing the opposite of what people expect, 

03:49 
kind of similar to stupidity. 

03:51 
Confusion and stupidity can kind of go hand in hand, 

03:52 
but you know, there's maybe a slight difference. 

03:55 
By the time you, the end of the, you watch this video, you're going to be like, okay, 

03:57 
does the kidney electrocute me or not, right? 

03:58 
He doesn't actually tell you. 

04:01 
he says no it won't electrocute and then he says make sure you use gloves though so you don't you 

04:06 
don't get electrocuted right so you're by the end of this you're like yo what the fuck i'm 

04:08 
confused like is it gonna electrocute me like he just said it will now or he said it just it won't 

04:11 
but now you need to wear gloves and like you're just gonna confuse people they're gonna be like 

04:13 
they're gonna watch it again chops your watch time they're gonna comment like what the fuck 

04:16 
i'm confused like this makes no sense blah blah blah so that's one of the most powerful ones ever 

04:19 
i think is confusion this is one that's not that new really um i saw people using this you know 

04:23 
over a year ago maybe even a year and a half ago i saw people like purposely using this tactic and 

04:27 
doing it and going viral um so yeah this is this is an older one but uh it's still slapped on i 

04:30 
think and it can be really really powerful you can do this with any product really um so yeah 

04:34 
there's boom there's three different examples of how you can use controversy to go viral without 

04:37 
attracting a really really bad audience now if you're still wondering like why is this so powerful 

04:40 
like yeah you you're doing these things but like what's the point of it um so the two things the 

04:44 
tick-tock algorithm really looks at are uh watch time and comments those are two massive things 

04:47 
that the algorithm is going to look at and if you have that if your video is performing well in those 

04:50 
metrics it's going to push it to more people right so what controversy does is it increases 

04:53 
the watch time right because people are gonna watch it twice because they're confused or they're 

04:55 
they don't understand it or they think it's crazy um so boom your watch time's gonna go up right and 

04:58 
then two comments right so whenever you say something that's the norm or you're 

05:00 
confusing people you say something stupid people just run to the comment section and they're gonna 

05:04 
leave comments they're gonna uh while they're in the comment section reading the video is replaying 

05:06 
in the background so you gotta think about that for your watch time but yeah you're just gonna 

05:09 
spark up these conversations these comments and it's just gonna boost your 

05:12 
your video on the algorithm pretty simple honestly but yeah so that's uh that's it that's my thread 

05:15 
that's the that's the video i hope you found this helpful um if you've used any of these tactics 

05:18 
please you find some success please be sure to let me know i always love to hear people you know 

05:21 
find success with the things i share so yeah that's it for the video peace out boys
