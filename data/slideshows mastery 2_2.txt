00:03 
You're trying to learn because people could be one-hit wonders. 

00:05 
If they do one good slideshow, it's like, all right, I'm done, and they stop learning. 

00:09 
Then finally, just show up to account reviews and do everything you can to get better. 

00:12 
Finally, reposting. 

00:14 
It's basically free views where you just download your TikToks and put them on Instagram and Facebook. 

00:17 
You don't have to make any new content. 

00:20 
So to do this, you take your slideshow, TikTok, you go to one of these two things. 

00:23 
They both work, and you put your link in there. 

00:25 
And then it's going to let you download each image individually. 

00:27 
So you're going to get all your images of your slideshow with no watermark or anything. 

00:30 
And then you go to CapCut and you, like, upload all the images into the video. 

00:34 
It should be, like, three seconds each or whatever. 

00:35 
You want it to be, like, three seconds. 

00:36 
And then you put transitions and music that fits your slideshow. 

00:39 
And then so once you have all this in there, it should be about three seconds per slide, seven slides. 

00:43 
It'll be about 20 seconds, transitions, everything loaded in. 

00:46 
Then you're going to go to Facebook and Instagram emails, and you're just going to upload it there. 

00:50 
There's some people saying 10 reposting phones. 

00:52 
They just keep reposting, and that's basically free views. 

00:55 
And then so the people working in the five-figure premises and, like, MiracleMu and all those really good brands, they have, like, seven phones. 

01:00 
They just repost on every single one. 

01:02 
So reposting is going to, like, 10x. 

01:03 
After you've, like, brand deals and retainers, please do not charge more than you're worth. 

01:06 
Just saying that off the rip, you're going to burn so many relationships if you do. 

01:09 
So use opportunities channel we have in Collective. 

01:11 
You're going to go in there, apply for everything you can, and determine if it's something you want to work with or not. 

01:15 
So once you have your offer, go in. 

01:18 
And then focus on overdelivering. 

01:20 
So, like, say you have a client who wants 30 slideshows for the month, but you're a beginner. 

01:27 
And then just focus on building relationships and just getting to know everyone. 

01:30 
Because I think I've gotten more deals through DMs than actual, like, job boards. 

01:35 
And you never know what's going to happen. 

01:37 
And then finally, a little bit about me. 

01:38 
So I got the slideshows around May. 

01:40 
I literally had no experience. 

01:43 
And then over the summer, I put in each 12 hours every single day on TikTok. 

01:46 
Like, weekends, weekdays, it didn't matter. 

01:48 
So I just put as much work as I could. 

01:50 
And then I was doing, like, two or three account reviews a day. 

01:52 
Like, I had people call me, like, when there wasn't any account reviews. 

01:54 
I had people hop on the phone and give me feedback. 

01:56 
The more sauce you get, the better. 

01:58 
And then I slowly and slowly got better. 

01:59 
May, my highest view was, like, two or three K. 

02:02 
June, I signed a brand deal. 

02:03 
And then halfway through that, I got a million one. 

02:06 
So keep showing up. 

02:08 
You literally will blow up overnight, I'm telling you. 

02:10 
Just take an open mindset, willing to learn, willing to work. 

02:13 
And trust me, you are going to win. 

02:14 
And then this mindset can be applied from literally anywhere, whether it's sports, life, business. 

02:18 
Just keep showing up and keep putting in the work, and you will win. 

02:21 
And then, so yeah, thank you for watching. 

02:23 
And if you have any, like, personal questions or, like, any feedback you want, shoot me a DM. 

02:39 
Alright, what's going on everyone? So this is a slideshow on common slideshow mistakes that myself and the other managers are seeing this fall. So let's just get right into it. First being the same images are being used a lot. For example, this bee pollen image right here. After somebody went viral with it the first time, every single person has used it. I don't even know how many times. I can't even count how many times I've seen this bee pollen image at this point. 

03:09 
So when it just goes viral, when the first ever person to go viral with an image goes viral with it, okay, you want to hop on the train a little bit, try it in one or two posts, that's fine. But putting it in all your posts and just because it went viral and someone else's post, assuming that that's going to be the reason your post goes viral, simply is not true. What you really want to do is notice that this bee pollen image went viral. 

03:33 
Right? Then you want to go do some recent...
