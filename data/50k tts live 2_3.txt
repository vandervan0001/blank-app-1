02:49 
like your laptop or say 

03:03 
going to have somebody who comments oh i tried this product before oh my gosh it's only ten 

03:08

03:30 
pinning comments every minute and i know a pin comment last one minute and you want to be pinning 

03:38

live they'll see that initial pin product that that's one of the first things they see and they 

04:24 
will see oh my gosh this product is so cheap this product is so amazing and that'll be the first 

04:28 
thing they see which will make them want to buy it more if they see other people talking about it 

04:36

04:40 
comments of you literally just typing you're like oh this product is so amazing and so cheap and 

04:46 
they changed my life is if you pin that product even no if you pin that comment even of yourself 

04:50 
then that'll be the first thing people see and it'll make people want to buy more because 

04:54 
they see all those testimonials of other people and that's honestly what makes people want to buy 

04:59 
the most is when they see other testimonials and other people talking about a product that's already 

05:04 
changed their life but that is an absolute sauce method definitely be pinning comments left and
