is this thing about getting zero views, but in my Discord recently, I've been getting a lot of 

00:08 
questions about it, and I want to share it with you guys, just my knowledge on it, what to do, 

00:15 
how to help. For Urgent, is this thing about getting zero views, but in my Discord recently, 

00:25 
I've been getting a lot of questions about it, and I want to share it with you guys, 

00:29 
just my knowledge on it, what to do, how to help. 

00:31 
you guys blah blah blah so let's dive into it so introduction when i say zero views i mean 

00:34 
legitimately zero not 100 to 200 like low level views i mean like literally zero like this and 

00:39 
sadly enough well actually not sadly because it's not a big deal it will likely happen to you and 

00:42 
it's not a bad thing don't freak out if you ever see this happen um i get a lot like recently i've 

00:46 
had like four or five in the last week people like y'all mad zero views what's going on and most of 

00:49 
them had no issues after a certain amount of time which i'm about to i'm about to explain to you so 

00:52 
what does it mean what do i do it almost always means you're under review and it's like it's it's 

00:57 
no different than how instagram reviews your content before i post anything like that or 

01:01 
instagram actually does in a way where i think after like within five minutes of you posting if 

01:04 
there's something they didn't like they'll take it down so they post you automatically for a little 

01:06 
tiktok especially on new accounts will just do it by not giving you any views first and they're 

01:09 
just going to check if everything's okay so like i said it's very common on new accounts it can 

01:12 
happen to others i remember one time back when my brand was at like 500k we were going through a 

01:15 
weird period where like one in every five videos would be on zero views but after we give it 24 to 

01:19 
48 hours it would be back to normal and go on its own little run hit the for you page like normal 

01:21 
so think of it like a tax audit i saw someone online say this and i was like that's such a good 

01:24 
way of putting it because tiktok's just reviewing your content mostly and you can check this by uh 

01:27 
if you go to share and you press like share copy link it'll put up an error message uh where it'll 

01:32 
be like yo uh this content hasn't posted yet so you cannot share this link and that's how you know 

01:36 
it hasn't been posted yet and still under review um and if it shows that you can copy paste it 

01:40 
then it's not under review and it might just take some time to populate it's another issue 

01:42 
it doesn't populate later which i'll get into next but most of the time you can check right 

01:45 
away see if you get that error message that means it's under review if so give it 24 to 48 hours 

01:48 
most likely when you check back it'll have already gone on its own little run of getting views 

01:51 
whatever it's not a big deal this does not mean your accounts hurt this happens to a lot of 

01:53 
accounts and you guys are totally fine um also like one of the kids in my discord was like 

01:57 
uh i was like dude why are you freaking out it's only been like six hours whatever he's like yeah 

02:00 
man it's just like annoying when you when you're excited to get tons of views i'm like be careful 

02:03 
of high expectations like that too you know i'm giving you guys the principles to do everything 

02:05 
you need to do on tiktok and like get to success eventually doesn't mean it's just gonna happen 

02:08 
overnight you know that's not the tiktok mindset the tiktok mindset is making good content and 

02:11 
putting stuff out there that's entertaining and follows principles not necessarily just 

02:14 
being attached to the short-termness of everything 

02:16 
but continued if it lasts longer than 48 hours to a week and you still are at zero views it was 

02:19 
probably something that happened against tick tock's guidelines usually it'll uh it can even 

02:23 
pop up and say like community guidelines as you know the other part from the course about community 

02:25 
guidelines um but not always sometimes it'll just stop you at zero views so that's like essentially 

02:29 
a shadow ban um i don't i don't really know what the actual dictionary definition of shopping is i 

02:33 
guess that's one of the ways i could agree with that but essentially you did something wrong so 

02:35 
like you might have reposted content from another account that you stole reposted content that you 

02:38 
only even but it's just like already been on tick tock before maybe it's restricted content like if 

02:41 
you post like a naked person on tick tock like it won't post like you can try this it won't post 

02:45 
right away um so that's like an example or something that tick tock thinks is in that realm 

02:48 
sex like something that's too like uh offensive in the text whatever it is basic stuff guys it's not 

02:52 
like like it's stuff that you would make sense you can't put on tick tock it's the kind of stuff 

02:55 
that they're not vaping smoking those kind of things they're not going to like let you post 

02:57 
that obviously so um if it lasts longer than 48 hours to a week something's probably wrong 

03:01 
um and that would be what it is if you don't just get like a notification that tells you about what 

03:04 
it is but there's no need to delete the video or account like you know i'm not really too much into 

03:08 
the the idea that deleting videos like ruins your optimization of the account but i don't think like 

03:12 
you need even ever need to do it really so there's no point in doing it like if worst case you could 

03:15 
private the video if you don't want it to be seen um or you could just leave it maybe it'll get 

03:18 
views later i've seen that happen to people too where you know then they have another video pop 

03:20 
off and it all trickles down um i've had it happen to myself so that's always an option 

03:23 
um and you definitely don't need to delete the whole account guys like expect to check the 

03:27 
analytics of your next videos after um just like from the analytics section of the course 

03:29 
go to post data look through after you know a few days of giving it time to pop giving it time to 

03:33 
populate and when you see like the part where video views are coming from and it says following 

03:37 
and it says for you page if it says for you page you're hitting the for you page you're good you 

03:39 
don't need to worry you're getting your chance on stage um if it says just following after a few 

03:42 
days to a week you know that's not the best sign um 

03:45 
it shouldn't persist if you're doing everything right like normally on your account making 

03:47 
content that's not against guidelines you know if it's against guidelines why are you even surprised 

03:50 
that you're not hitting the for you page but um it shouldn't persist but if it does you know you 

03:53 
can reach out to me i can see what it is maybe um or you can like send a message to uh support 

03:57 
maybe delete the account start a new one if you really want to it's early type shit but um most 

04:01 
most important like overall like if you're doing the right things you're gonna be fine um but 

04:05 
regardless these are all the precautions you can take to check see what's going on like most of the 

04:08 
time when people come complain about it they didn't check everything so like or give it time 

04:10 
it's one of those two didn't get enough time they didn't check it otherwise you should be fine guys 

04:13 
um so to conclude 

04:15 
don't panic if you see zero views most of the time it's just a review especially if it's a new 

04:19 
account it takes time like you can't expect to just get tens and tens of thousands of views right 

04:22 
off the bat every time on a new account guys some of them are not only gonna get low views but zero 

04:25 
views for a few days um don't panic for example i had somebody my discord um was freaking out 

04:29 
about it recently i told them to wait and that same video guys 72 hours ended up going on a run 

04:32 
to three million views so it's not like it's like your videos or your accounts it's literally 

04:36 
just a review i'd say 90 of the time 95 personally i've seen a good amount of these go um get the 

04:40 
zero view issue but if it gets taken down or not approved just let it go keep pushing and check 

04:43 
analytics like i said and you'll be fine 

04:45 
you don't need to leave it or delete your old account right away um and if you're following 

04:47 
the proper principles making the content yourself um posting original content following the even 

04:52 
the creators that you hire following the proper content i talked about the hiring creator section 

04:54 
and you're doing everything right not making stuff that's too sexual too crazy whatever it is 

04:58 
you're probably fine and have nothing to worry about and i can say that with full confidence 

05:01 
okay so that's what to do if you see zero views i think there's also some other bullshit people 

05:04 
put out there saying like zero views means this and that like i said with the algorithm stuff 

05:07 
ask what's your fucking source because they don't have one guys they don't have one i promise you 

05:10 
that so this is really the case i think other people that are pretty knowledgeable in the 

05:13 
space would agree with this and just say like ignore it keep going it's 

05:15 
whatever it's just a review or some bullshit i hope this helps we'll move on to the next one
