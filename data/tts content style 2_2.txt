00:01 
Um, it's a very simple style and it's still kind of works. 

00:06 
Um, it used to work even better, but basically just holding the products saying 

00:10 
like public service service service announcement, and just kind of yapping 

00:14 
about the product, right? 

00:15 
Public service announcement. This stuff is very potent. I have never seen a package deal like this. 

00:20 
First, you get Sour Stuff, and if you do not know about Sour Stuff, Google Dr. Sebi, because unless you live on a Caribbean island, this stuff is so rare. 

00:28 
And then you just talk about the product, the benefits, you know, blah, blah, blah, right? 

00:32 
Like, it's a very simple one. 

00:34 
Let me show you another example. 

00:39 
This is my honest review. 

00:41 
So this is a more like typical voiceover, right? 

00:43 
And you'll see this a lot from like influencers and stuff. 

00:46 
But this can, you know, this can crush on TikTok shop. 

00:49 
This is my honest review of the Homeika vacuum from someone who owns a big brand-name vacuum. 

00:55 
Now, I'm not going to throw rice or coffee grounds on my floor because I feel like any vacuum truly should be able to pick up dry product on a hard surface. 

01:02 
But here are some realistic things that I will be vacuuming every day. 

01:05 
These spiderwebs that I hate to... 

01:07 
you know, like it's pretty simple. She's kind of just giving it a review. The thing with this type 

01:12 
of content is you don't have to show your face, which is good for the people that don't want to 

01:16 
show their face. Yeah, just giving a review, showing the product, you know, a nice, smooth, 

01:21 
calm voiceover. She has a nice voice for it. But yeah, I mean, it's really this simple. And I mean, 

01:27 
probably crazy amount of sales. It's just like the whole video is just about the product. So 

01:33 
I'm sure it converted like crazy. So that's voiceovers. A few key points here. No empty 

01:41 
space in between words, which is huge. So you want to make it sure like, between sentences or 

01:46 
whatever, like make sure you cut out those pauses, make it fast, more fast paced. Keep people engaged. 

01:52 
Like I said, speak fast. Constantly don't get stuck too much on one part of the video, 

01:59 
constantly moving it. You know, you'll notice with hers is like, she's constantly, 

02:03 
you know, new clips, new areas, new blah, blah, blah. That's a big thing. And then a great hook. 

02:09 
Of course, you always want to have that strong hook. That's it for voiceovers. So now this is 

02:14 
a big one. Duets. This is kind of a newer thing. People are still figuring out, but Luis has 

02:18 
started doing this and is literally crushing with it. So I got his advice and this is what he told 

02:23 
me. So duets are the easiest and most effective videos to make. I posted about 10 videos using 

02:30 
duets and eight of them went viral and generated around $300. 

02:33 
For me personally. What I've noticed with duets is that you need to warm up the account for you 

02:41 
to be able to post duets without any problems. You also need duets. You also need to duet with 

02:47 
the top five videos going viral at the moment for the product you're running. Dueting old videos 

02:52 
doesn't work. Okay. So that's what Luis told me. Those are his tips. We'll pull up some examples 

02:58 
here in a second, but yeah. So like, like he said, you want to warm up the account a little bit 

03:03 
because duets seem to get taken down sometimes, give you violation points, whatever. So warming 

03:10 
up the account, I guess can help with that. And then yeah, I mean, that's, that's basically it. 

03:16 
Luis, I mean, the guy's an absolute beast. So let's, let's pull up some examples. 

03:22 
And this is just an example. 

03:25 
15 pounds in 20 days. 

03:28 
My name is Luis and this is my story. 

03:30 
It was in Spanish, but this is Luis right here. 

03:34 
You basically just duet a video, you know, promoting a product and you kind of just react to it. 

03:39 
Right. Like, look at all this. 

03:40 
Two or three months. 

03:41 
Everyone says when people recommend you. 

03:43 
doesn't even have to speak, right? He's just reacting to it. And, you know, throw up some, 

03:47 
you know, some text here and there, but that's it for a duet, man. And you can, 

03:50 
you can print money with this. So that's the first example. Let's pull up another one here. 

03:58 
I am a woman's man through and through. 

04:00 
I was raised by a house full of women. 

04:02 
So when my wife told me that she was just afraid that her body wouldn't snatch back after she had our baby. 

04:07 
This is promoting collagen, and this one's actually in English, which is nice. 

04:10 
I knew there was something I had to do about that. 

04:11 
Especially because I did not want her to slip into postpartum depression, so I went into research mode. 

04:16 
And as I was doing my research, I came across collagen peptides, specifically the ones by Microingredient. 

04:21 
Yeah. Like it's this simple, man. All he does is sit here and react. Doesn't even have to talk 

04:25 
really shows the product in his hands that he has it. And you know, he makes the money from this, 

04:30 
right? Like this guy reacting makes the money, not this guy, which is crazy. Yeah. There's a 

04:34 
little cheat code, um, something you guys could test out. And then lastly, I want to just say, 

04:39 
so those are like the four main TikTok shop styles that are just working right now that you guys can 

04:46 
test. But lastly, Spanish, right? So Luis actually, he does, he's made most, most of his 

04:52 
money doing Spanish videos. And all you do is you take these styles that I showed you and you just 

04:58 
switch it over to Spanish, right? And there's a massive audience for out there for Spanish speakers 

05:02 
in the U S and the, the other cool part about it is it's often times more untapped, right? 

05:11 
Because you have most people think, Oh, let's just make English content because most of the people 

05:16 
English speakers. So that the whole English niche has a ton of videos promoting products and stuff 

05:21 
like this. And then the Spanish content, there's not as much of it, right? So you kind of have 

05:27 
a less competition is, is what I should say. So here's a quick 

05:31 
We'll be right back. 

05:36 
Right. So, you know, you know, we don't need to watch this, but this is just a talking head content or talking head video. 

05:42 
And it's just all she does is talk in Spanish. Right. That's literally it. Right. 

05:47 
So. So, yeah, that's it for this video. Hopefully this was helpful. 

05:52 
We'll have tons of other videos in the course breaking down, you know, different, more in-depth concepts here. 

05:57 
Like we're going to have one on hooks, CPAs, stuff like that. But that's all. So peace out, guys.
