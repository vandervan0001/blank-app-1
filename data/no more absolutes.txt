00:05 
So what do I mean? 

00:06 
First things first, you have to understand that when people speak in absolutes about 

00:11 
the TikTok algorithm, saying shit like, TikTok loves this, TikTok does that, the algorithm 

00:19 
needs this, needs, has to have, all these absolutes is just saying that someone knows 

00:26 
absolutely no what the fuck, they have no idea what they're fucking talking about, right? 

00:31 
That's the only absolute that you should listen to whenever you hear someone say that, 

00:35 
is that they know absolutely fucking nothing. 

00:37 
have to understand that no one knows the tiktok algorithm not even people at tiktok know the tiktok 

00:42 
algorithm it's made with machine learning based on how users interact with it is how it shapes 

00:46 
itself it's changing every single day every single hour right this is why it's so amazing we know 

00:49 
that there's commonalities within it but we do not know exactly what is what there is no thing 

00:53 
released that tells you exactly what it is you kind of just have to assume which is why the 

00:56 
scientific method is so important the scientific method says we can only assume and disprove 

00:59 
basically make you know great assumptions at what and you know guesses and hypotheses 

01:03 
hypotheses i don't even know if that's the right way of plural but we can only guess at what it is 

01:07 
and then disprove those are the only things all things can be disproven so therefore it is 

01:10 
disproven it's the only proven thing false assumptions can kill you though right here 

01:13 
are some of my favorites people say the algorithm loves consistency you must post 10 times a day to 

01:18 
go viral or most notably i remember this uh is that what that fucker's name benjamin something 

01:21 
on on youtube who has the worst tiktok tips ever you guys should never listen to that dude um he 

01:24 
says you've got to post three times a day to go viral and if you're not posting three times a day 

01:28 
tiktok is not going to place you in a bucket and not let you go viral uh that's funny because i 

01:32 
had an account with over a million followers where we posted every other day for like two years 

01:35 
never once did we post in the same way 

01:39 
That's awkward that just disprove that you know and it's just like these things the list goes on and on here's some of the 

01:43 
ones I hear you guys say a lot you can only have X number of 

01:46 
Accounts per phone. I messed that up folks per account. You only have three three accounts per phone 

01:50 
Otherwise you you're gonna get flagged you can only have five accounts. Oh if I made this account with this email 

01:54 
It's not gonna work. Oh, did I get flying because I had too many accounts on my phone, bro 

01:57 
I've had eight accounts on my phone or like 

01:59 
as long as I can fucking remember, and I have never had a problem going viral. 

02:02 
Saying link in bio will kill you, and you won't be able to go viral, 

02:06 
I have a video with 35 million views that says link in bio at the end. 

02:09 
It has to be shown that it's a real person. 

02:11 
That being said, I know Cal has done that, and he likes to do it. 

02:15 
There's no point in not if it just brings you peace of mind. 

02:17 
But saying it with these ideas basically takes yourself away from the responsibility, 

02:22 
Some of these things are good things to do, and I think have some reason within them. 

02:27 
For example, new accounts get more reach. 

02:28 
It is common to see that new accounts, the first video, a couple videos, 

02:31 
will get a little extra push. 

02:32 
Maybe TikTok's trying to figure out what you're doing. 

02:33 
But then at the same time, I see accounts that have 80 views on the first post. 

02:36 
Your content still is almost always going to be the leading factor here, right? 

02:50 
All of these things are excuses that are going to take you away from the reality. 

02:52 
They're going to take you away from just taking responsibility for your content. 

02:54 
It will take you so much further, guys. 

02:56 
And I have seen way too much data from students and myself and my campaigns. 

03:01 
I have too much data backup that focusing on your content and making stuff that will 

03:04 
cause you to stop and watch the video yourself is going to take you the furthest, okay? 

03:09 
As long as you're making good content, you are good. 

03:11 
Detach yourself from the short-term views. 

03:12 
Detach yourself from worrying about having to get a million views the first week you 

03:15 
Just make good content, right? 

03:17 
And focus on making content that would make you stop and watch it yourself. 

03:21 
Some other things that go along with this, with this whole, like, kind of, 

03:22 
asking for handouts and assumptions and just victim mentality within this. 

03:26 
How do I find winning products? 

03:27 
Is, you know, these things all go along with this, right? 

03:30 
Like, there's too many variables to answer these ones. 

03:31 
This is, like, a different type of, like, you know, kind of. 

03:33 
bad question to ask like these uh how many times on your post before i know it's winter uh how many 

03:38 
posts have you done how many products have you tested um you know is what kind of niche are you 

03:41 
in there's just so many different things right and most notably like how many products have you 

03:44 
tested in my opinion because like it took me six seven products before i found my first winner 

03:47 
right so i could have had the best product ever not have the skills and you know i could have 

03:52 
done 100 posts and not known that it was a winner right just because you didn't go viral doesn't 

03:55 
mean that it's not a winner um is it is it one that's already been winning before you know like 

03:58 
Or is it untapped and you're the first one to it? 

04:00 
Like, there's just so many factors that go into that. 

04:01 
And even where it's like, how do I find winning products? 

04:04 
There's videos here on how to find winning products, how to choose winning products. 

04:07 
You'll see the best thing that you can possibly do with products. 

04:12 
You signed up for dropshipping, my friend. 

04:15 
This is dropshipping and e-commerce. 

04:17 
It's going to take even more time doing this TikTok organic shit because it's not ads. 

04:24 
But you did not sign up for something that's get rich quick. 

04:26 
If you want to start making money the whole time you're making content, check out Creator's 

04:29 
Because dropshipping, you are signing up for fucking three to six months of hell. 

04:32 
You've got to show up every fucking day and test some shit. 

04:34 
That was my product tangent right there. 

04:36 
So, to conclude, focus on what's in your control. 

04:39 
Don't focus on these fake absolutes. 

04:40 
Don't focus on what people are telling you that you need to do in this black box and 

04:42 
spin your phone around three times and give it a kiss to go viral. 

04:44 
Bro, make good content. 

04:48 
If you're not going viral, you probably need to make better content or just post more good 

04:56 
And the more you focus on it, the better your life is going to be in this space, bro. 

04:59 
This is why I've been around in this space so fucking long. 

05:00 
Because I understand this so fundamentally and I've seen it too many times to where it's 

05:04 
I can see a campaign and I know what to do in every situation and it always comes down 

05:08 
to making emotion-sparking content. 

05:11 
You must jump in the water and find which way is up. 

05:12 
You don't ask someone, how do I figuratively swim? 

05:15 
When I go under the water, how do I get back up? 

05:17 
No, you throw him in the water and you figure out which way is up. 

05:18 
And that'll teach you how to really do it. 

05:20 
Get in the mode of action.
