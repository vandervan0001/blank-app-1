Yo, what's going on boys? So this video, we're going to be going over taking inspiration from 

00:10 
viral videos. Uh, this should be another pretty quick video. I'm not trying to drag these on. 

00:15 
I'm trying to make these as quick as possible, not waste any of your guys' time. So let's get 

00:17 
into it. Taking inspiration from viral videos. Okay. Finding viral videos in your niche. So this 

00:22 
is, this is pretty simple. You're going to search up keywords for your niche size product, uh, in 

00:26 
the TikTok search tab, and then just filter by most liked, um, or it'll say like light count. 

00:30 
So basically it's just going to put the videos that went the most viral at the top of your thing. 

00:33 
And you can look at those. Um, so if you're, if your product already has a decent presence on 

00:38 
TikTok, you can kind of just like search up the name of your product and you might find some 

00:41 
videos that way. If not, you can try to just search up to the niche that you're in. So if you 

00:44 
sell, you know, some type of like skincare products or you sell a basketball or like whatever, 

00:50 
whatever you're selling, think of like what your niche would be in. Um, so you can look up like 

00:53 
skincare or you can look up like cool basketballs, like try to find things similar to your niche. 

00:56 
That way you can find viral videos, um, with, you know, your product, or at least a product 

00:59 
similar to yours. And then you can use these viral videos, um, and recreate them. 

01:03 
So the first thing, once you find a viral video, um, in your niche or with your product, 

01:07 
the first thing I want you to do is study the hook. Um, you want to study, like I'd say 70% 

01:11 
of the time you contribute the success of a viral video to the hook. So, you know, pay attention to 

01:14 
the hook, try to recreate it very similar. Um, it worked once, it'll likely work again. And you 

01:18 
want to pay attention to, you know, both the visuals and the text. So on this example I have 

01:21 
here, can't believe people are still getting this toxic, these toxic vapes, right? That's the text 

01:24 
hook. That's what you're going to make them read and try to intrigue them with. And then the other 

01:27 
part to this is the visuals. So, um, you're going to see, okay, this, in this example, they, 

01:33 
they took a bunch of vapes and they, they shoved them into a glass jar with kind of a cool, um, 

01:37 
nice view in the background, right? So that you're going to study that. So maybe you're gonna be 

01:39 
like, okay, I'm going to get a bunch of old vapes and I'm going to get some sort of container that's 

01:43 
clear. And then I'm going to go, I know the spot near me or near my house. That's a good view in 

01:46 
the background. Now I'm going to take all those things and I'm going to make a video of it. And 

01:49 
that's going to be my hook. It's going to be very similar to this, but obviously a little bit 

01:51 
different. Um, and then, yeah, so like I said, you're gonna study hook first and really try to 

01:56 
figure that out because that's one of the most important things. Then you want to study the 

01:59 
rest of that viral video. Um, so pay attention to things like the sound, the length of the story 

02:04 
time, et cetera, like pay attention to all these small details. Um, like for, for this example here, 

02:07 
you know, I would, I would look at this video and I would say, okay, how long was it? Was it 

02:09 
five seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds. Like that's number one. Cause I'm going to try to stay within 

02:13 
that, that range because there's a reason it worked. Um, next. Next time, maybe I'll look 

02:29 
at the sound that they used, right? I might use the same sound. I might use a different sound 

02:31 
that's similar to it, but I'm going to pay attention to that. Is the sound turned up all 

02:34 
the way? Is it turned down half? Is it really low? I'm gonna also pay attention to that, uh, 

02:37 
the storyline. So, um, for the rest of this video, I'm going to, so they started out with, 

02:41 
I can't believe these people are still eating these toxic babes. What do they say next? Do they 

02:43 
say, um, I found an alternative, uh, blah, blah, blah. Here's the alternative, you know, pay 

02:47 
attention to that too. And you want to kind of, when you recreate this video, you want to keep 

02:50 
all these components as similar as possible. Um, because like I said before, there's a reason a 

02:54 
video goes viral and you want to make sure you're kind of keeping everything similar enough 

02:59 
to, to where when you recreate it, it'll go viral again. Um, now it's not saying everything 

03:02 
has to be exactly the same. You know, you can have slightly different backdrops. Maybe you 

03:05 
word it slightly different. Maybe there's something, um, you even improve on. Now, 

03:08 
the first time I suggest kind of recreating it pretty similarly. And then if that doesn't work, 

03:12 
you can always recreate it. But maybe you're like, Hmm, maybe if I switch one little thing, 

03:15 
maybe the hook's a little bit different, the length's a little bit longer, but then you can 

03:17 
start to like switch around the components and maybe improve upon the video even. So that's it 

03:21 
for this video, kind of just going over, taking inspiration for bio videos, which I think is 

03:24 
really powerful for beginners. Um, if you're, you know, if you're kind of new and don't have that 

03:28 
much experience, it's hard to really create a good video out of nothing. Right. So that's why 

03:32 
I tell people, um, go, go out there and do this, go find viral videos, study them and try to 

03:36 
recreate them. And you'll, you know, you'll get a feel for what it's like to make a very good video. 

03:39 
You'll kind of increase your chances of going viral because you know, you're taking something 

03:42 
that already worked. So yeah, this can be pretty powerful, but that's it for this video. Hope it 

03:46 
was helpful. See you guys soon. 

03:58 
So first, what am I actually going to talk about?
