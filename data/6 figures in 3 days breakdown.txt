yo what's going on boys so i just wanted to make a quick video sort of breaking down the store 

00:13 
that has definitely already done over six figures um and it's currently still blowing up right now 

00:19 
this video right here that's almost at 12 mil this is at like eight mil like a few hours ago 

00:24 
when i looked so it is currently blowing up and it's absolutely insane this account's been created 

00:29 
for three days three days ago this account screened and it's already absolutely blown up 

00:34 
seven mil two mil now we got another 12 mil yeah so i want to take a look at this and talk to you 

00:39 
guys why it works what they did right and everything and how you guys can kind of use this 

00:41 
as an example for yourselves going forward and learn from this so first of all i think they did 

00:45 
a great job of sort of branding this and making it look like it's a legitimate brand um now this 

00:49 
this name doesn't really have to do with the product it's not you're saying what the product 

00:52 
is or like something like that it's kind of just a general branded name it fits right it fits the 

00:55 
niche because when you look at this this content and like what it's based around it's like this 

00:59 
name just kind of fits with it then they got relieve your most beautiful moments uh sale going 

01:02 
out into the holidays limited stock billboard 

01:04 
see i like that um but instantly when i came across this i wasn't sure if it was drop shipping 

01:07 
at first which is a really good sign they're doing something right someone like me i can 

01:09 
usually spot drop shipping from far away but let's take a look at some of this content real quick 

01:26 
okay so as you can see super simple content anybody watching this could definitely could 

01:29 
easily make this content i'm sure you guys are all thinking the same thing and then look at these 

01:32 
comments i want to buy this now for christmas guys y'all should launch where can i put my 

01:34 
buy this? I was going to get this for Christmas, but it's $190. Someone tag me when it launches 

01:38 
for launch. Everyone is obsessing over this. Look at this, 3,000 comments on it. Where can I buy 

01:42 
this? God, this is so fucking amazing. Let's look at some of the other big videos. 

01:51 
Simple content, man. Anyone can do it. 

01:58 
All right, so a few things I want to talk about. First of all, what they're doing is they're 

02:01 
hitting people in their emotions, right? So they're using the right sounds to make people 

02:04 
feel nostalgic or hitting people in their emotions, and then mixing it with a product 

02:08 
that obviously has to do with emotions and connections and people, whatever. So that's 

02:11 
one thing they're doing really well. Secondly, which is really interesting, is they launched 

02:14 
this three days ago. That was right on Black Friday, or maybe on Saturday or whatever. 

02:18 
But they launched it right before the holidays, and this product is obviously a big gift product. 

02:21 
So it's hitting people. People are looking for gifts right now, and they see this, it's 

02:23 
going to grab their attention. So they timed this really well as well, which I don't even 

02:26 
know if they did it on purpose. They might have just came across this and launched it 

02:27 
randomly. But they definitely either got lucky or planned this timing out really, really 

02:30 
well, right time of year. It was huge. And then the third thing I want to talk about 

02:34 
So the reason I think these videos blow up, not only when he turns it, it's just that 

02:40 
wow factor. It shocks you because it's like a moving image when he turns it, and it just 

02:43 
looks really cool. That's that wow factor I always talk about. This is a perfect example 

02:46 
of a product with a wow factor. And then let's take a look at the website as well. So obviously, 

02:50 
three days, they racked over 20 million views, very product-focused content, so they're obviously 

02:54 
getting a lot of attention on their website. Let's take a look at their website. 

02:56 
So I briefly looked at this, and I thought it's definitely pretty solid. It doesn't come 

03:00 
across, I don't think a lot of effort really went into this. It's pretty simple, but it 

03:04 
Branded, right? There's not much to this. They have these little badges, some basic 

03:07 
ass reviews, picture words, picture words. This is a nice infographic, whatever. And 

03:12 
then short little description, clean little section here. But it's all super simple, right? 

03:16 
But you guys are watching this right now, and you probably think the same thing as me. 

03:18 
It just looks good. It just looks clean and branded. These colors match. Everything matches. 

03:21 
And then the big thing I preach a lot is the product images. These look very professional. 

03:25 
They're simple, but they look very clean and professional, which does a lot for your website. 

03:29 
So yeah, it's a simple website, and I'm sure it's converting extremely well. And even, 

03:31 
they have a high price point, which is sort of high for TikTok. 

03:34 
Some people say you can't do stuff this high on TikTok, but you definitely can. I always 

03:37 
shoot for low budget or for low ticket, but high ticket can convert as well. Mini Katana 

03:41 
sells swords for over $100. Definitely can be done, so don't get stuck in that world. 

03:46 
But yeah, that's kind of everything. I really want to go over this just because it's blowing 

03:48 
up right now. And if you guys want to go check this out, we'll see how much farther this 

03:51 
video goes. I wouldn't be surprised if it hits 20 million, to be honest with you. But 

03:53 
yeah, it's a great example of just basically printing six figures overnight, just absolutely 

03:57 
crushing it. But yeah, that's basically it for the video. Hope you guys enjoyed. Hope 

03:59 
you guys took some tips from this and learned a little bit. But yeah, that's about it. 

04:04 
Yo, what's going on, boys?
