00:01 
maybe I should try that tequila. 

00:03 
Why does Alex Earle mention this makeup brand 

00:05 
because all the people are influenced 

00:06 
by Alex Earle's definition of an influencer? 

00:07 
That's why you're not necessarily an influencer 

00:09 
or an influencer if you can influence people 

00:11 
And essentially, you're basically trying to be 

00:14 
You can also use this in health news 

00:15 
with like a doctor or a researcher 

00:16 
or a holistic health expert or a coach. 

00:18 
And you don't necessarily have to be an influencer. 

00:20 
But you can add some authority to yourself 

00:22 
either by saying, well, I talked to my doctor. 

00:23 
I talked to my mom who knows a lot about this. 

00:24 
My friend who does a ton of research. 

00:27 
All of a sudden, you have done the research for them 

00:28 
and you are now an authority over them. 

00:30 
Even though 36 before, you're just like a random person. 

00:32 
you read the reviews, you talked to a doctor, 

00:34 
now you become that authority that tells them, 

00:37 
So liking is where people need to know, 

00:40 
They're buying a product, but you are the messenger. 

00:43 
it's because we look angry at the person 

00:45 
If I told my friend that his mom died, 

00:47 
he'd probably first lash out at me 

00:50 
So I'm automatically associated 

00:51 
by proximity with the message. 

00:53 
That's the negative side of it, 

00:53 
but on the positive side of it will be that 

00:54 
if they have a liking to you, 

00:55 
if you look like them, if you're part of their tribe, 

00:57 
if you smile, if there's some sort of aura or charisma, 

00:59 
this is why attractive people can sell stuff so well, 

01:02 
but partially because of the halo effect 

01:03 
We like people that look good 

01:05 
more than people that look ugly. 

01:07 
well, they're just like my friend. 

01:12 
And a way that you can use this for TikTok shop 

01:13 
is make it seem natural, make it seem relatable. 

01:15 
So get ready with me videos, cooking videos. 

01:16 
There's so many girls that will sell products 

01:23 
It's you and me, and I like this product, 

01:26 
where one person starts saying some slang 

01:33 
They all move to the same city. 

01:37 
buy the same products. 

01:39 
And this is a unity, 

01:41 
but yeah, those are the most important ones. 

01:43 
I think the most related 

01:44 
is going to be urgency and scarcity 

01:45 
for your call to actions, 

01:50 
And you can throw social proof 

01:50 
in the call to actions as well. 

01:52 
So how do we actually understand 

01:54 
Because it's cool that you have 

01:57 
but what is most applicable 

02:00 
would be to talk with 

02:03 
you're not going to go on a Zoom call 

02:06 
But assuming you have a product 

02:09 
in certain places with that product 

02:10 
and then understand the customers 

02:11 
even better than they understand themselves. 

02:14 
which is an ideal customer profile. 

02:19 
the person who has the pain 

02:23 
the person that's morbidly obese 

02:24 
and can't walk to see their kids 

02:26 
they're feeling that really strongly 

02:27 
versus just a dude 

02:31 
who's readily able to buy, 

02:33 
and is looking for that solution. 

02:41 
plug that keyword into Amazon. 

02:43 
Like Zoyaba, for instance, 

02:45 
If you look up Zoyaba on Amazon, 

02:50 
with full-length stories 

02:51 
going into all of the problems 

02:56 
and they will go into in-depth 

02:57 
and they will use specific language 

03:01 
because if you talk the same as them, 

03:04 
and this product solved your problem for you, 

03:08 
Ultimately, you want to understand 

03:09 
The mechanism is the unique supplement. 

03:11 
So for Zoyaba, 

03:13 
20 different ingredients in it. 

03:15 
is that you get all of the nutrients 

03:17 
you take one Zoyaba pill. 

03:19 
all of those nutrients in it, 

03:21 
well then it can solve XYZ problems. 

03:25 
is that it makes you 

03:26 
and because of that, 

03:28 
So Zoyaba could solve weight loss 

03:30 
because you eat all this processed food, 

03:35 
it's going to reduce your weight 

03:37 
That's one way to solve weight loss 

03:39 
and another way to solve weight loss 

03:45 
and this is important 

03:55 
what problem that solves, 

03:58 
well then go on r slash skincare, 

04:03 
and they will then write books 

04:04 
and stories about everything 

04:07 
and then you can fit your product 

04:10 
TikTok shoppers use more like Amazon 

04:15 
often in like broken English 

04:32 
it's people from whatever place 

04:37 
and then TikTok comments 

04:42 
because questions will tell you pain points. 

04:47 
Has anyone used this before? 

04:54 
oh, does this help me lose weight 

04:54 
on a 15-day cleanse product 

05:03 
and I lost a ton of weight 

05:04 
or they took Zyobin 

05:05 
and it gave me a mood boost 

05:09 
from the customers themselves 

05:23 
Generally, you want to have some basic demographic info. 

05:25 
Most important is just going to be age and gender, 

05:27 
and then the actual problem that they're facing, 

05:29 
and their interests around this. 

05:30 
So not interested in, like, oh, do they play pickleball? 

05:33 
But more interest as in relating to the product, 

05:35 
and relating to the problems, and relating to the product. 

05:37 
Specifically, you want to understand the wording. 

05:40 
You've got to talk exactly to the customers 

05:41 
to get them to trust and like you. 

05:43 
Now, the next stage is awareness level. 

05:45 
But this is now trying to understand, 

05:46 
if you're looking at a bunch of different customers, 

05:48 
how aware are they of the problem? 

05:50 
How have they tried to solve it? 

05:53 
Unaware, which means they know literally nothing. 

05:55 
Problem aware, they know you have a problem. 

05:56 
Solution aware, they know there are other solutions. 

05:58 
Product aware, they know your product is a solution. 

06:01 
So you want to understand, one, where people are at. 

06:03 
Do they know absolutely nothing about this product, 

06:04 
the problem, or the product, or other solutions? 

06:06 
And then if so, you want to move them down 

06:07 
the awareness level towards buying your product. 

06:09 
So for example, because this might be a little bit 

06:16 
I'm being fat, it isn't a problem, 

06:18 
they're not trying anything, they're just fat. 

06:21 
Now after that, they know they're fat 

06:23 
They're like, okay, I know I'm fat 

06:29 
Next, they know they're fat, they want to fix it, 

06:46 
your stage you're for most people on tiktok they're going to be somewhere between b and d 

06:50 
mostly b or c now you want to change your messaging based on the awareness level because 

06:55 
it's like okay this is cool there's an awareness how does this actually help us so depending on 

06:58 
where they are at then you're going to change how you talk to them because if you're talking 

07:01 
to a person let's say i want to sell a weight loss bill if i'm talking to a person that is 

07:04 
just they're just fat and they know that no nothing i can't sell the weight loss bill because 

07:06 
i'm like take this weight loss bill they'll be like why i'm fine i'm just fat i don't care right 

07:09 
so if they're completely unaware then i have to tell them did you know that being fat is bad 

07:12 
have you seen these studies you know about cholesterol you know you're gonna die earlier 

07:14 
you know you can't do x y and z right start to bring them over to being aware that there's even 

07:17 
a problem because if there's no problem why would i buy if i'm finding that why would i buy your 

07:19 
weight loss bill i don't need to change anything there needs to be a problem first before you can 

07:21 
incite change and if people don't want to incite change they're not going to purchase anything 

07:24 
because making a purchase is an action right so you can see how this goes all the way back to 

07:26 
direct response you want to incite the response which comes from the problem so next problem 

07:29 
aware if they're at this stage they know that being fat is bad but they don't know about all 

07:32 
these solutions so then you can tell them did you know that you can take weight loss bills to stop 

07:35 
being fat so now you're introducing a solution now it's not your product it's not even another 

07:38 
brand it's just in general there are pills out there that you can take to lose weight now next 

07:41 
after that would be solution aware did you know that we have the best weight loss pills so they 

07:46 
know that there's a problem they are fat they want to change it and they know there are weight 

07:48 
loss pills but they never heard of your product because they just know that there's a solution 

07:51 
out there so then you have to introduce your product to them and if they're product aware 

07:53 
well now you have to get them over the finish line and this is where the thing will slightly 

07:55 
change because now you've gotten them to the awareness level that you want and now you need 

07:58 
to incite action so this is where you get the persuasion back
