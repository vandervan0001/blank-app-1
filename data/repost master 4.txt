00:04 
Um, there's, you'll be able to find the video, it's pretty easy, like I said, and then, uh, 

00:11 
Squirtle 14, tips to save time, so the only places you can really save time when posting 

00:19 
is Instagram and Facebook, because those are the only ones that I've seen that allow you 

00:23 
to have drafts in your drafts, so, like, Instagram and TikTok allow you to keep drafts, like 

00:29 
I said, if you have multiple posts to do that day, so download the videos in advance, 

00:35 
and have the posts ready in your drafts, so when it comes time to post, all you have to 

00:44 
do is hit post, and not have to go through the whole downloading and going through the, 

00:48 
making the post process each time, you know what I'm saying, so, just download the videos, 

00:54 
make the post, save it as draft, if you have three posts to do, um, make those three 

00:59 
post and save them as drafts and then you want to wait at least one hour in between posts that way 

01:05 
um the algorithm so that way you allow the algorithm to 

01:10 
push that video you know i'm saying you don't want to post all three videos at the same time 

01:18 
i've found that when you do that the views get low that's 

01:29 
that's just it's not for sure but every time i've done it if you try posting three posts at the same 

01:48 
time they're not going to perform so you want to do one post at a time wait at least 45 minutes 

01:56 
to an hour i usually time i'll do an hour um usually i'll set like if you don't want to just 

02:03 
you can set alarms so if you have three posts 

02:18 
do a post then send an alarm for an hour later once the alarm goes off do that post 

02:36 
you just go on your drafts click post boom easy easy money and then you do that you repeat that 

02:53 
until you're done with all your posts um same with facebook 

02:56 
um facebook doesn't um oh yeah tiktok is the other one that allows you to keep drafts so you 

03:08 
can do the same thing on tiktok have your post ready and when it comes time to post just go on 

03:15 
your drafts and hit post and that's it um for facebook it doesn't allow you to do drafts as 

03:22 
far as i've seen so the best you can do is just save the videos that you're going to 

03:27 
on facebook for that day save it on your camera roll ahead of time you can make a folder on your 

03:35 
camera roll for each client so you have three posts for one account make a folder for that 

03:40 
one account so that way when it's time to post you can easily distinguish what posts go where 

03:45 
when it comes to time 

03:46 
you 

03:56 
I'm the post you know what I'm saying so that's a time saver make it easy 

04:04 
um tips to stay consistent and keep your clients happy that's something that I've done too as well 

04:23 
um 

04:23 
so 

04:26 
I think you guys if if in your discord dms with your client you guys uh should send eos 

04:37 
shift report along with the date and number of times you posted on whatever platform you posted 

04:56 
um 

05:02 
for that client at the end of the day or whenever you're done reposting for that client so it should 

05:08 
look a little like this this is what mine look like eos report 228 facebook posted two times 

05:15 
you know I'm saying when you make a deal to repost for someone and you're talking to them and giving 

05:21 
them details let them know that you will send updates every day after you post to let them know 

05:26 
that you posted you know what I'm saying uh clients will like this because they'll know you're doing your job and it'll also keep you consistent because you know if your client doesn't see that 

05:38 
that eos report 

05:45 
you 

05:46 
that's fine
