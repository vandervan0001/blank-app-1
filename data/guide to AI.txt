00:11 
The tools that you're going to need to get started are ChatGBT, which you've probably used before, Leonardo.ai, there's an image generator.

can also use mid journey we'll cover that in a different video but leonardo is a better tool 

00:52 
for beginners who have never made images in ai before if you already know how to use mid journey 

00:58 
though feel free to swap out this step with mid journey instead of leonardo then 11 labs will be 

01:06 
another tool that you need to create the ai voiceovers and audio

01:37 
and then CapCut as well. 

01:42 
If I had to lay this out in the most simple step-by-step process that I can. 

01:46 
would be one, create the script of ChatGPT, those are the words that you're using. Two, 

01:52 
create the visuals of the Inari.ai, those are the images and visuals that are going 

01:57 
to be part of the video. Three, create the voiceover and sound effects in 11 Labs. And 

02:03 
then four, upload all three of those, upload the voiceover that you've made using the script 

02:11 
of ChatGPT. 

02:12 
You can keep output and upload the visuals and all of that into Comcast. 

02:17 
in CapCut, CapCut's a video editing software. 

02:18 
That's a video editing software, we're going to show you how to use that here in the tutorial. 

02:22 
real 

02:23 
upload it in the catpad you edit it and then you export 

02:30 
scrim. So with that, we'll jump into the joy here and kick it over to one of our AI specials. 

02:34 
stop taking ashwagandha you might have heard that 

02:43 
that it makes you more relaxed. 

02:45 
You might have heard that it turns you into a nonchalant gigachad. 

02:49 
But what if I told you that both of those things are true? 

02:54 
That being said, you must be aware of the product you're using. 

02:58 
There are a lot of fake brands to avoid if you want to actually experience the benefits listed. 

03:04 
Luckily, you can get real, authentic ashwagandha from Goalie Nutrition by clicking on the TikTok shop under this video. 

03:14 
Let's start by creating images in leonardo.ai. 

03:20 
In my opinion... 

03:22 
The best tool for beginners to start creating images. 

03:26 
If you don't have access to the platform, registering is as easy as any other website. 

03:29 
Registering is as... 

03:32 
I already have access and will use my Google account to access. 

03:36 
On the home page, look for the Create Image option in the side menu. 

03:41 
The platform is very intuitive and easy to use. 

03:44 
I recommend that you browse it a little to learn. 

03:47 
Here, I choose the size of the image. 

03:49 
As I want to make an image for a video nine by 16, 

03:53 
I manually choose this size here. 

03:55 
Here, I click to choose the artistic style. 

03:58 
I will choose the cinematics. 

04:01 
dial to create the art again i recommend that you browse the platform to learn 

04:06 
it is very easy i will create something similar to the model video 

04:07 
I will create something. 

04:10 
for that i will analyze each of its images when analyzing the first image i come to the prompt box 

04:11 
I will analyze 

04:13 
When analyzing 

04:16 
Here, I write the command prompt, a woman wearing gym clothes holding a stop sign. 

04:21 
Click here to generate, and just wait a bit. 

04:26 
Four options were created. 

04:29 
Because in this menu, I left it enabled to create the four images. 

04:34 
I liked this one, and I'm going to download it. 

04:37 
I'll do the same with the other images. 

04:40 
Hey, I need to go to the bathroom. 

05:05 
I'm sorry. 

05:17 
I will use CapCut to edit this video. 

05:19 
You can download the editor from CapCut.com. 

05:22 
Start by creating a project and import the photo you created into CapCut. 

05:35 
After importing, place the images on the timeline in the correct order. 

05:45 
I will create a narration using the website 11labs.com. 

05:49 
I will make a narration similar to the original. 

05:52 
You can choose several voices to narrate. 

05:55 
Browse the website to discover the options. 

05:58 
Take ashwagandha. This is serious. 

06:31 
You may think that it will make you more relaxed, or with a more athletic body. 

06:37 
And if I reveal to you that yes, both of these pieces of information are true, 

06:41 
After that, I will import the generated voice into CapCut. 

06:43 
Support the generation. 

06:45 
And I will place. 

06:45 
And I will place it on the timeline. 

06:47 
No, no, no, no, no. 

06:52 
No! 

06:58 
It's me who wants to see it. 

07:01 
Wait, but there are some where it flows from the nose, it goes, but... 

07:05 
It's not the Kokomo. Wait, I'm going to clean you up. 

07:08 
It's me! It's me! 

07:11 
What I'm moving is called the editing needle. 

07:31 
It's responsible for indicating the place where an action will be taken. 

07:35 
To make the video more dynamic, I'm going to use the editing needle to make the video 

07:41 
It's okay, we were fine. 

07:44 
Yeah, that's right, we were fine. 

07:51 
I will cut out unnecessary speech gaps. 

07:54 
Position the needle.
