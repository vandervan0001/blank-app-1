and how to sell. 

00:33 
By the time you get to the end of the content with your video response show, you want them 

00:51 
to remember that they are very interested in buying products. 

00:56 
This can be done by studying and doing a few reasons from that day. 

00:59 
Remember, going viral is nothing more than a skill that can be learned. 

01:01 
You have to make it clear that the product is part of your business. 

01:04 
You can't show it on screen for .5 seconds in a blurry clip and expect people to understand 

01:08 
Whether you have a CTA or not, if the product is never clearly shown or mentioned in at least some way, how do people ever know what to buy and or what exactly are they buying? 

01:16 
And to touch on this point again, like you, when you say, oh, the CTA, I mean, your video should be made, your video or slideshow should be made so well that people are thinking, oh, I want to get their feedback. 

01:27 
And there should be a point where it's like, how do I get it? That's where the CTA comes in. You let them know how to get it. 

01:31 
All right. People actually have to know you're selling a product. Product-focused content. 

01:40 
It's tied in a lot to when you're at the university. You don't even watch the video for the wrong reasons. You also don't want people to not trust you. 

01:45 
Put care into your content. Going back to why I said glowing when the course is about, people buy from people they like. 

01:50 
That being said, you also don't want to be too slow. People will open up the TikTok app to be entertaining, not to be sold to. 

01:57 
There will always be people you need to care for. 

02:01 
A well-made product-focused video is a small enough CTA. 

02:08 
Where to put it? At the end of the post? The caption or description? Like I said in the other course video, the caption should always be used to help you out in some way. 

02:14 
Any simple link and bio in there will help you increase your success. 

02:16 
Or reply with a comment. I will go over more at the end of the course. 

02:19 
No, don't type out link and bio in the comments. TikTok may pick up on this and suppress your reach. 

02:24 
Feel free to type it anywhere else, like the caption, the description, text on screen in the video or slideshow. That's completely fine. 

02:30 
CTA is for video. 

02:31 
Get creative in how you say it. 

02:33 
While yes, I'm in the video with a simple link and bio, there are other ways to go about it. 

02:36 
Plus, social proof. 

02:38 
If your product is already trending, has a large number of units sold or reviews, all you need to do is support and let people know. 

02:43 
Same thing like a product that has 100,000 units sold, 5,000 5-star reviews, etc. will help boost people's strength in the video. 

02:49 
Utilize sales and digital. 

02:52 
This strategy has been used for years now because of CTA. 

02:56 
Want to sell? Let people know. 

02:58 
That's all you need to do. 

03:01 
You want people to buy, and you want them to buy right now. 

03:03 
This can be done by using sales tactics like flash sales and scarcity. 

03:06 
Flash sales are sales that are only available for a limited time. 

03:11 
Because they're only available for a limited time, people will feel the pressure to buy quickly before the sale ends. 

03:15 
If you're going to do this, please make sure the item you're selling is actually a limited time. 

03:18 
Scarcity is when you're thinking about the sale of a product. 

03:20 
Telling people it's an item you're selling is actually a limited time. 

03:23 
This can help people prove you wrong. 

03:25 
One, people will feel pressure to sell it because it's a limited time. 

03:27 
Two, it shows so quickly. 

03:29 
The only reason people don't want to sell it is because they're not sure when the sale ends. 

03:33 
It's hard to tell when the sale ends. 

03:35 
It's hard to tell when the sale ends. 

03:37 
It's hard to tell when the sale ends. 

03:39 
It's hard to tell when the sale ends. 

03:41 
One way you can do this is to see something like, 

03:43 
there's been a crazy sale the whole month of this. 

03:45 
If you want to see if you can go at a discounted price, check out the listing below. 

03:47 
Check out the link in my bio. 

03:49 
See how that now builds the intrigue to see if there's a sale. 

03:51 
So then they click to see if there's a sale, and boom, they're on the stock page. 

03:54 
They're one step closer than that. 

03:56 
Example CTAs for me. 

03:58 
This stuff is selling out fast. 

04:00 
If you can see the orange cart button down below, that means it's getting hot, so get some quick. 

04:03 
This one is for a TikTok channel. 

04:05 
I wait like three weeks for the thing I can sell. 

04:07 
I just got myself three vinyls, and I know it's going to sell out again really soon. 

04:10 
If you want to get some, get it while you still can. 

04:12 
Another. 

04:14 
You don't have to listen to me. 

04:15 
Instead, listen to the thousand plus other people who have five more reviews. 

04:18 
Check them out below. 

04:19 
Saying that is another way to bait them into clicking the listing. 

04:21 
Like I said, look at all the reviews. Check out the reviews. 

04:23 
How do you get to the review page? You have to go to the listing. 

04:25 
It really is situational. 

04:27 
Depending on your video, a simple link in bio or getting the TikTok shot below CTA can be worked just as good. 

04:32 
You want the CTA to fit the tone of the video and flow nicely with the camera. 

04:35 
As you keep waltzing in your journey, you'll have to start to learn what is best for you. 

04:38 
Don't overthink this part too much. 

04:40 
CTAs for slideshows. 

04:42 
They should just about always be on the list. 

04:45 
CTAs for slideshows are a tiny bit different. 

04:47 
In a video, if you want to pay a longer CTA, like I have to wait three weeks for something I can sell, I just got myself three vinyls, I know it's going to sell again really soon, 

04:52 
you want to get some, get it while you still can. 

04:54 
People are just looking at me. 

04:57 
Slideshows are for all the kids. 

04:59 
That one CTA, you don't want to use slideshows. 

05:02 
That is because they'll be a match of the name X at once on the screen, 

05:05 
and because since people have to read the caps on slideshows, they have to use brain power to do so. 

05:09 
And like I said earlier, people are on TikTok to be entertained. 

05:12 
So nobody's going to sit there and read a whole paragraph of why a product is so great and they need to learn how. 

05:16 
So how should you keep CTAs in your slideshows? 

05:18 
A simple link in bio can go a long way. 

05:20 
It doesn't take up too much text space. 

05:22 
And there's the process of the review. 

05:24 
Another way is to recommend the product in a familiar, casual way. 

05:26 
For example, if you're telling a story of how someone used a product that was really, really, extremely, heavier than ever, 

05:31 
a good CTA in the last slide could be a picture of the product saying how, 

05:34 
this is what she used. 

05:35 
I'll put the link to try it on in my bio. 

05:37 
The whole story is about a hair growth journey. 

05:39 
Another example is this. 

05:41 
Say you're making a slideshow on how to train for a marathon, 

05:43 
assuming you are selling something that helped with that. 

05:45 
For this example, let's say you're selling an app that helps optimize a training experience. 

05:49 
Once you get to the last slide, you're going to pull up a product in the PhD app. 

05:52 
A good CTA would look something like, 

05:54 
I wouldn't be nearly as prepared designing an app if it wasn't for this. 

05:56 
You get a free, optimal, personalized training routine just for me. 

06:09 
It's not going to be as great as my personalized training routine just for me. 

06:11 
That would be one little flex block. 

06:14 
It's called Go Run. 

06:15 
I want to try it. 

06:16 
So it doesn't have to be one giant thing. 

06:19 
Look at that. 

06:27 
No, you can. 

06:30 
and then you can add link in bio or something similar in. 

06:38 
let's just say you want the CTA to fit the tone of the live video. 

06:53 
as you progress in your journey once again don't overthink it too much 

07:00 
it's a more cta sense you don't even feel like a friend 

07:03 
to make people think 

07:06 
for example say you were selling a supplement how a lot of other people are selling like 

07:11 
why should people buy those and they're not competitors you need to let people know you 

07:15 
are number one best choice this can be done by saying things like this nearly brand i know 

07:20 
that harvest or ashwagandha 100 organic there are a lot of fake ashwagandha sellers i like 

07:25 
the most trusted one below i find a super affordable brand and linked below you see 

07:29 
how that differentiates what you're selling from the other competitors they're not necessarily 

07:33 
speaking negatively on you always take a pause reply to comment videos as i mentioned in the 

07:38 
beginning of this video i'm going to get into it sometimes videos will borrow when they don't 

07:42 
have any cta that is fine sometimes it's best for you to focus on going borrow first and then 

07:46 
selling your product other times you may have not made it other times you may have not 

07:49 
made your cta as a parent or as strong as it needs to be well maybe you didn't have 

07:53 
anything to go viral and you just want to squeeze some more traffic and conversion no stress
