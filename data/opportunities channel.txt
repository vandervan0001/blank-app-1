Hello, everyone. So, welcome to the explanation of the Opportunities Channel. 

00:10 
So, this is going to be your goldmine for finding brand deals, yummy creator, finding TikTok shop deals, even reposting deals in this Discord. 

00:19 
I think this is honestly the most valuable part of the Discord. 

00:23 
Now, with the Opportunities Channel, it's an incredibly valuable resource. 

00:26 
We've literally had millions of dollars flow through here over the last two years, and that is not an exaggeration. 

00:31 
We have to learn how to use it properly. 

00:33 
So, first of all, how this works is that it is a job board. 

00:37 
So, you're allowed to post once per day, and there are a couple of rules, so you don't want to be spamming too much. 

00:42 
You can see most of these are pretty short, no massive pictures, don't be posting multiple times per day. 

00:48 
But if you use it properly, you can go crazy. 

00:50 
So, the biggest thing that we're going to look for is, one, finding brand owners to DM. 

00:54 
We're looking for creators, affiliates, TikTok shop, reposters, and then also posting yourself. 

00:58 
So, first to find brands, if you look just in the last day and a half, 

01:03 
So, if we're looking, we can see, you know, there's a bunch of people who are hiring creators right here, 

01:10 
pet creators right here, people who are buying accounts, there's a bunch of them. 

01:14 
So, you're looking for the people that are brand owners that are looking for creators, and they might have specific niches. 

01:20 
So, for instance, seeking pet creators with all this stuff, all you have to do is just DM them, click this button, 

01:26 
so click on this person's profile, send them the DM, look at the communicating with brands for the scripts and how to communicate with them, 

01:35 
I would recommend DMing the people that are posting, depending on what they're looking for. 

01:39 
So, for instance, if they're saying a pet creator, you don't have a pet, and you don't have access to a pet, then probably don't DM them. 

01:46 
But if you're interested in a drink enhancement brand, you can reach out, post, and you can see there's six other people who also DM them. 

01:53 
But don't worry, a lot of these brands are hiring 5, 10, 20 creators at a time. 

01:57 
So, just send the DM, shoot your shot. 

01:59 
Now, don't spam everyone, but I think at least sending a couple DMs per day... 

02:03 
...is pretty useful. 

02:04 
And just scroll through here every day. 

02:06 
There's like 5, 10, sometimes 30 posts in a single day, and you can go back a couple days and see for everyone. 

02:12 
Now, for instance, this other guy needs three creators, so you can hire him and see what's going on there. 

02:17 
The other side of this is going to be posting yourself, and I think you should use both sides. 

02:22 
You can also see that there's creators. 

02:24 
For instance, Haley here, this is a really good message saying that she's an organic creator. 

02:28 
Here's the portfolio. 

02:29 
This is what she's looking for. 

02:31 
I've generated 6 million views. 

02:33 
If you mention types of brands you've worked with, a link to a portfolio or videos, and especially the amount of views, that is going to be the most important part. 

02:41 
And you can check by the amount of DMs that people are getting for the best posts. 

02:47 
And you can use those as an example. 

02:48 
So, if you're unsure and you're coming to this channel for the first time and you're like, what do I post here? 

02:52 
Well, you can just see, okay, so what are these creators posting? 

02:55 
This guy has one example, but there's not really much going on here. 

02:59 
It just says, got you with the sample, lots of experience. 

03:01 
This part's pretty good, but it would be helpful. 

03:03 
If you included like a retainer or views or a portfolio, right? 

03:08 
So, you could look at like Haley as an example or anyone else who's posting. 

03:12 
Now, again, you can only post once per day. 

03:14 
Check out the rules. 

03:15 
They're here in the pinned messages. 

03:17 
So, just make sure that you're following those. 

03:19 
And if you're posting every so often, you're sending DMs. 

03:23 
Typically, you'll be getting brand deals within a couple weeks of being in the program. 

03:32 
And then you can kind of go. 

03:33 
And then once you have a couple deals, then you can kind of work with those brands, 

03:37 
come back to the Opportunities channel, check it every now and then, 

03:40 
and then you should be good to go. 

03:48 
So, a couple things to talk about with the Opportunities channel. 

03:51 
Getting clients again, reading the rules, 

03:53 
look for the people with the most envelope emojis. 

03:55 
That's indicating interest. 

03:57 
And this is a job board. 

03:58 
It's not really a chat room. 

03:59 
So, you're not going to be messaging like, hey, guys, what's up? 

04:03 
As if you're posting a job opportunity, I'm looking to get hired, 

04:06 
or DM the people who are looking to hire. 

04:08 
And don't be scared if you're a beginner. 

04:10 
If you've never had a brand deal before, 

04:11 
if you've never made TikTok content in the first place, 

04:13 
you can post and say, hey, I'm looking for commission-only deals in these categories. 

04:17 
I have no views, but I'm excited and ready to go. 

04:20 
I can make one video per day. 

04:21 
I'm in the U.S., something like that. 

04:23 
And you can DM a lot of those brand owners as well 

04:26 
and look to the communication video for how to do it. 

04:29 
Again, DM consistently and post consistently. 

04:31 
Don't spam, you know, 20 people in a day. 

04:33 
But post once every couple days. 

04:35 
DM a couple people every couple days. 

04:37 
If you show up and keep sending DMs, keep posting, 

04:40 
you're inevitably going to be getting some deals. 

04:42 
Once you have a job, you can kind of chill with the DMing and posting 

04:44 
and just look for new opportunities. 

04:46 
Now, there's other ways to get deals outside of Discord. 

04:49 
For instance, TikTok Shop. 

04:51 
We've kind of covered in the Kalo data section how to find some of the products, 

04:55 
And then that one, you can look outside of the Discord 

04:57 
and potentially just do an open collab or add it to your showcase. 

05:01 
And you don't really have to communicate with the brand. 

05:03 
Those are going to be commission only, 

05:04 
so you're not going to get any retainers there. 

05:06 
You can also use Instagram. 

05:08 
Find brands on TikTok if you're scrolling viral videos 

05:10 
and then DM them on Instagram. 

05:12 
However, this is going to be very, very difficult 

05:14 
because most brands are not on TikTok. 

05:17 
Most brands are not going viral. 

05:18 
That's why the Opportunities channel is the best opportunity 

05:20 
because these brands are actively looking for creators. 

05:22 
If you DM a bunch of brands on Instagram 

05:24 
and you DM a bunch of brands on the Opportunities channel, 

05:26 
you're going to have a much higher success rate. 

05:28 
I'm just mentioning it because it's another option. 

05:30 
You do want to look for brands that are already going viral. 

05:33 
For instance, like Cloudy here. 

05:36 
They have a bunch of different creator accounts 

05:37 
and you can kind of just look up Cloudy on TikTok 

05:39 
and you can see all the different accounts they have. 

05:42 
That's usually a good interest that they're going viral 

05:45 
as opposed to a brand that's just running ads. 

05:47 
Probably not good to DM them. 

05:49 
In terms of outreach, you can open with this message. 

05:51 
Hi, brand name. 

05:52 
Are you looking to hire content creators 

05:53 
to make viral videos for your brand? 

05:54 
If they respond, then you go through the same process 

05:57 
from communication video, onboarding, probably different. 

06:00 
It might be Discord, Slack, or email. 

06:03 
Twitter is also a really great place to find brands. 

06:05 
But if you have no experience and no followers, 

06:07 
I would not recommend this. 

06:08 
So this is a little bit more advanced. 

06:10 
I would recommend going through these three accounts. 

06:12 
This is me, Jimmy, and Cal. 

06:14 
And you can follow those people that we follow. 

06:16 
Good place to network. 

06:17 
Good place to find brand deals. 

06:18 
You can DM some of the brands 

06:19 
and you can start to message some of the brands as well. 

06:23 
If you can see, these are a bunch of the accounts 

06:25 
in Creators Corner, which is our higher level coaching program. 

06:28 
All of these are successful creators. 

06:31 
So you can kind of model 

06:32 
your content after those people. 

06:35 
But I would say to start, if you're a complete beginner, 

06:38 
just use the Opportunities channel. 

06:39 
And then you could potentially use TikTok Shop as well. 

06:41 
And check out the Caleb Ditto video for that.
