00:00 
What are they? 

00:30 
Oh 

00:30 
TikTok shop violations occur when you break one of TikTok's... 

00:33 
Pee pee. 

00:34 
and they assign you violation forms every year. 

00:37 
Do you know of anywhere? 

00:39 
Sometimes you don't do so many things in life. 

00:41 
Thank you. 

00:43 
Unless you have put in a certain number of inhalation. 

00:46 
and ability to sell products on technology are either temporarily or permanently banned. 

00:51 
And once you hit 24 points, that is the game. 

00:55 
All violations count. 

00:57 
TASOC has been strict recently regarding violations. 

01:00 
For the most part, if you make sure you follow the rules, you should be good to go. 

01:05 
And we'll be going over those shortly. 

01:06 
he's only 

01:07 
That being said, sometimes TikTok can give them out with no logical reason behind it, 

01:12 
I am, but that is a lie. 

01:12 
but that is not necessarily a problem. 

01:14 
I don't even know what this is. 

01:14 
I don't know what this is, I don't know what the fuck. 

01:17 
You cannot appeal them. 

01:17 
I don't feel them. 

01:18 
Yes, you are able to appeal them. 

01:20 
In some cases, TikTok will give you the option to do a quiz, 

01:24 
and if completed correctly, you can get violation points for both. 

01:28 
Now not all users have this they are still slowly rolling 

01:33 
Don't stress about it. 

01:36 
Although they are annoying, there are still many people hitting crazy profit numbers with TikTok job affiliate every day. 

01:43 
Just be conscientious about the content we make and post, but don't overthink it. 

01:48 
Read through the documents I have attached below, and I will be going over them as well super quick. 

01:53 
No need to memorize everything in them now, but spending at least 10 minutes or so, 

01:57 
and at least checking over and understanding the bullet points is very much so important. 

02:01 
so 

02:03 
So these are the two documents I have linked below. 

02:06 
Hello? 

02:07 
Like I said, there's a lot of information on these, so don't get overwhelmed or anything. 

02:11 
Don't think you're going to be... 

02:13 
tested on your tick tock shop knowledge by me or anything like that you know you don't have to 

02:17 
recite this information nothing like that i just want to make sure that no stone is left unturned 

02:23 
you have all the information that will help you just so it's there but going over these super 

02:30 
quick they both just break down you know common reasons for violations what you shouldn't do in 

02:35 
videos to avoid violations the most common reason for violations on shop it says what's not allowed 

02:41 
and it also says what is okay violation days just going a little more in depth on the violations 

02:48 
and some frequently asked questions if you don't really know too much about 

02:51 
pick-up shop violations still i would recommend starting with this frequently asked questions 

02:56 
section on the violation sheet and we also have this one 

02:57 
violation sheet, and we all 

03:01 
where it's essentially the same thing, it just goes in-depth, 

03:04 
but that right here, it also goes into the quiz feature 

03:08 
and gives a little insight on that 

03:11 
and some helpful information on there as well. 

03:14 
So like I said earlier, you know, don't overthink it. 

03:18 
Don't stress out. 

03:19 
It's just part of the game. 

03:22 
That's all there is to it. 

03:23 
So that being said, check these out.
