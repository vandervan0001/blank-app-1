How to find trending audios, my friends. 

00:05 
Let's get into it. 

00:06 
It's one of my favorite topics. 

00:09 
Trending audios are high key the backbone of TikTok. 

00:11 
I feel like every single video on TikTok, you know, usually uses some kind of audio. 

00:15 
Dance trends, humorous trends, slideshow trends, all these different things, right? 

00:18 
And I think it's one of the things that makes TikTok so special is that, you know, they're 

00:21 
able to give you access to so many different sounds. 

00:24 
And, you know, it's definitely something I've used for a long time in terms of my TikTok 

00:27 
I will say, though, in the recent ages of 2023, 2024, the art is getting lost. 

00:30 
And a lot of people are losing the ability to find good audios and, you know, effectively 

00:34 
use them into their videos, especially in the trend style. 

00:36 
They can be used in so many different ways for so many different emotions and, you know, 

00:40 
You know, there's times where trends, you can literally just take a trend that people 

00:42 
are using for dances or, you know, posting their boyfriends, alter it and post a product 

00:46 
or something like that, which is one of my favorite strategies, as well as you can also 

00:48 
just take audios and put it back there to drive some kind of emotion, you know, where 

00:51 
there's like maybe a sad audio that you can use for an emotional type product, or you 

00:53 
can use a fear-based audio for a fear-based type of supplement. 

00:55 
You can do a lot of different things with that. 

00:57 
So where to find them? 

00:58 
These are my three favorite places to find trending audios, scrolling your For You page, 

01:01 
cherry-picking them off influencers, and best of all, the collective. 

01:04 
So scrolling the For You page, pretty self-explanatory. 

01:06 
You want to scroll through the For You page and literally just have your, every time you're 

01:09 
scrolling, you want to be very, very, very conscious, right? 

01:11 
So when I'm scrolling through the For You page, I'm like, show me what the fuck you've 

01:13 
Like, I'm always looking for different, you know, trends going on, different products, 

01:17 
And when I'm scrolling and I hear a sound that's like, oh, what's this? 

01:20 
I've never heard this audio, whatever. 

01:21 
I'm clicking on the audio and checking when this audio was made, how many videos have 

01:28 
number at the top of how many recreates have been done to it. 

01:30 
And then you'll see all the videos under it that people have made to it, right? 

01:32 
I'll scroll through like the most recent nine, 10, 11, whatever, just real quick, check 

01:35 
If all of them are in the last two to three weeks, specifically like in the last week 

01:38 
even too, it doesn't really matter, but really like recent, and there's a high number of 

01:41 
videos made to this sound, like at the top, if it's 20 to 50,000 plus, 100,000, 200, 300,000 

01:45 
plus, I know that this trend has serious legs, right? 

01:47 
That to me is the best, those are the best trending audios. 

01:49 
It doesn't always follow this criteria, right? 

01:50 
Like there's also times where, you know, there's a really funny audio that has maybe 

01:52 
5,000 plays that I know I can do a really good video to, or there's times where it's 

01:55 
a little bit of an older trend, maybe a month or two old, and I feel like, you know, I can 

01:57 
still make a really good video to it and play off of it. 

01:59 
But, or for example, if it's just like that emotional audio set in the background, that's 

02:02 
not going to be something that always has to be trending. 

02:04 
But in terms of using these ones that are following this criteria, for the most part, 

02:07 
it's at 80, 90% you're trying to use that criteria, at least when you're doing those 

02:10 
The reason why I feel like it's so effective is because it's like top of mind consciousness, 

02:13 
Everybody on TikTok is already knowing these trends, already like, you know, participating, 

02:17 
laughing along, liking these types of videos. 

02:18 
Because you're just trying to fit into what's currently going on. 

02:20 
You know, you want to blend in on the 40 page. 

02:21 
You want to have videos so good that people would stop and scroll, and it blends in with 

02:23 
what's currently working, right? 

02:24 
So that's why I feel like trending audios are so amazing, is like you can just easily 

02:27 
tap into something and be trending right away, like automatically. 

02:30 
And, you know, that's why I'm always saving up the favorites, right? 

02:31 
Every time I see something fit that criteria, I'm just, boom, add a favorites, add a favorites, 

02:35 
And now I have this whole collection of audios that I know I can scroll through if I have 

02:37 
any video inspiration for products or trends going on, whatever. 

02:40 
With saving them, saving those sounds, plus saving those videos to different folders, 

02:44 
If you know how to use folders and save sounds, you're going to know what's happening on TikTok 

02:46 
almost all the time. 

02:47 
It's high key, the biggest hack you can do, and it takes, you know, 20, 30 minutes a day. 

02:50 
Then, if I'm feeling like I'm lost, you know, or I just want to get a check on how many 

02:52 
audios, probably once, twice a week, I'll go to a bunch of different influencers and 

02:55 
just see, like, their last nine to 10 videos, what they're doing, any audios they're using. 

02:59 
So I'll look at people like Charlie D'Amelio, Olivia Ponton, all these motherfuckers in 

03:02 
the hype house, any of those, like, young influencers, right? 

03:04 
Sadie McKenna, Emma, whatever, McAllister, something like that. 

03:07 
I just go to all those young people. 

03:08 
They always are using the best trends for the most part, and I'll be, like, falling 

03:12 
looking for this criteria, and I'll just cherry pick audios off of that, right? 

03:14 
Save them, boom, and I'll interact with their stuff so their stuff comes back up so I can 

03:17 
Like, my For You page is almost entirely, like, products, influencer videos, homestyle 

03:21 
videos, and, like, that's, like, all I look at on TikTok, and a little bit of basketball 

03:26 
Because that's all I care about in the market, and this is, like, such an easy way. 

03:30 
Like, you don't even have to, like, really scroll the For You page if you just cherry 

03:33 
Like, same with, like, Bryce Hall, Josh Richards. 

03:35 
Like, they're always doing those trends at the top, and, yeah, you can just see if you've 

03:38 
Between these two, you'll pretty much get every single trending audio. 

03:39 
Like, it's really fucking simple, to be honest with you. 

03:44 
Like, just people are always posting shit in here. 

03:45 
You can literally see, like, this one was trending at this time. 

03:48 
You just pop in, take them, add them to your favorites, and the links are right there for 

03:51 
Another great way to cherry pick. 

03:52 
So, in conclusion, there's a reason this video is only six minutes long. 

03:56 
Rinse and repeat these, and you'll pretty much have every single trending audio you 

04:00 
And rinse and repeat every single week, day over day, and you'll always know what's going 

04:03 
on on TikTok, and people will be like, oh, my God, how do you always know? 

04:07 
The trends and saving videos will get you everything you need. 

04:09 
I think I'll be having another video on this course about, you know, using folders. 

04:12 
Very important to be using folders and saving everything you can to favorites, but this 

04:15 
I'm telling you, not rocket science.
