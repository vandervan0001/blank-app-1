00:02 
It's just bad lighting and bad background. So it's a small thing that you can fix, right? It's not that, okay, you're going to have better lighting now and now you're going to go super viral. These are just all small elements that add up into a viral video. So we'll go over an example of each one of these as we're going to talk about bad lighting, bad background. This is my boy DJ here. So you can see it's kind of a plain white background. It's really not much going on. It's not visually engaging. It's not really visually engaging. Again, that's not, if you have a nice painting on your wall, if you have a plant behind you, it doesn't mean you're going to go viral. It just helps visually improve the quality of your video. And the lighting could be better too, right? You can step outside in this video, get natural sunlight, maybe just go by a window. 

00:32 
I know there's like a $20 to $25 light that you can attach on your phone. I think a lot of people were talking about within these different channels. If you want to know, I can send you a link after the call. But yeah, just small ways to improve the quality, the visual quality of your video. It's just plain white background, not really great lighting. Just things that I've been seeing a lot, and that's already DJ here, but just things I've been seeing a lot that can be improved. 

00:51 
Oh, hold on. Sorry, I'm with people in here, guys. If you could please mute up as well. I'm hearing a couple people. Let me do it again. 

00:55 
Yeah, so lighting is definitely a simple one, a simple fix. It's not the hardest thing to do, right? Like, just get more natural lighting in your videos, or get a ring light, get a light that attaches to your phone, and you can improve the quality of the lighting in your video. It's very simple, but just something I've been seeing over and over. 

01:08 
For the background, right? Like his video, it's just a white background. Again, it doesn't have to be a crazy background. Maybe you have a plant in your house, maybe you have a backyard, maybe you have a front porch, or maybe you have a parking lot by your home. Like, it's just more, it's just a small aesthetic thing that improves the quality of your video. 

01:17 
So that's one. Another big thing I see a lot in these videos is just kind of quickly skimming through the pain points and the benefits, or either or. You might be quickly skimming through the pain points, and you went really far with the benefits, or vice versa. And I'll give you an example of this right here. This is some common things. I'm looking at the video to slow it down. Let's see what we have here. Let's slow it down up here. Okay, so let's play it. So in this case, I'm just going to play the video. I'm going to play a longer part of this video here. 

02:17 
point and then you could bring up your body now continue it i think she kind of talked about the 

02:19 
benefits but again kind of quickly skims over it and go to the product so yeah she just so quickly 

02:31 
skimmed over like why you should take this product why is this product better like a lot of videos 

02:34 
you'll see people comparing two products energy products they'll compare my product x other 

02:38 
products will dive into that in this call also but she's like diving into all of the issues of 

02:41 
why tanning beds are bad and she's like you only need 10 supplements it has this supplement this 

02:44 
supplement and in that case that's just an example of somebody explaining the features of the product 

02:47 
without explaining the benefits and if you're trying to sell something the only thing people 

02:49 
give a about the only thing people care about is how can this help me how people are selfish 

02:52 
all they care about is themselves how can this help them so they don't they probably don't know 

02:54 
what any of those supplements are so that doesn't really help them much so you want to dive deeper 

02:57 
here into like okay this is why this tanning supplement is better because yes it has these 

03:01 
supplements and this is what they do for you um so kind of yeah just kind of she kind of quickly in 

03:05 
over the benefits and the quick that she uses explains that the pain points well why you 

03:08 
shouldn't be doing tanning so that's not the worst part here it's just kind of so quickly you're 

03:11 
getting over the actual benefits the practical benefits of how they can help 

03:14 
them why they should actually buy it um so yeah so that's the first right so bad lighting bad 

03:18 
background quickly giving pain points or benefits like that's the thing that people actually care 

03:21 
about the pain points is these are the problems that i have and the benefits is how how this 

03:25 
product helps you get over those people so don't quickly come over that that's the meat potatoes 

03:28 
that's what actually helps sell them the product that you're trying to sell um let me go into the 

03:31 
doing here if you have any questions or comments for whatever reason i cannot see yes uh one message 

03:59 
to do and this will be the third one here let's let it load sorry my dog's going crazy in the 

04:03 
All right, so this is dead space or awkward silence, whatever you want to call it. 

04:14 
There's probably more in the video, so I can keep playing it. 

04:15 
But when you start the video, there's like a second, a second and a half, two seconds of the silence before you say the word. 

04:18 
I can easily be cut off when you edit the video. 

04:19 
And the next sentence before you say the word is another second or two of the silence before you start speaking. 

04:23 
Like, you have to remember when you're making these videos, everybody's attention span is so small. 

04:25 
Like, that one second is all they need to scroll away and not see the rest of your video and not buy whatever you're trying to sell. 

04:29 
So these are small things that can be done, right? 

04:31 
Right there. 

04:38 
Like, he kind of like puts the video, presses the play button, and then stands up and then starts speaking. 

04:40 
Like, make sure you're cutting all of those awkward silence and all of the dead space out of your video because that is, it's just dead space that's going to cause people to scroll away from whatever you are doing. 

04:49 
All right, and then the last one here, this is probably one of the biggest ones that I've seen. 

04:52 
It's just being too silly and showing the product way too quick. 

04:55 
Like, here's the product, this is why it's okay to buy it, and we'll show an example here. 

04:57 
I think this is a Spanish content example, but the principles still remain. 

05:07 
So in this video, it's not the worst thing, it depends how you do it, but you really don't want to just be like, yo, this is the best product ever. 

05:12 
Like, just write a video about the same sentence and then just going into the video. 

05:14 
Like, you want to, I'll show a better example of this a little bit later, at least go now, but you kind of just show instantly showing the product. 

05:19 
Like, there's a few times where this can work, like, you know, where you're trying to use reverse psychology, you're trying to trick them with the product. 

05:22 
Like, don't fall for this scam product or don't whatever. 

05:24 
That's a different style of video where maybe you show the product early on and then, you know, whatever. 

05:28 
But you don't want to be like, yo, this product is so great. 

05:29 
You want to build up to it. 

05:31 
You want to build up to the next thing, which we'll go into, which is actually a perfect segue. 

05:34 
So instead of just, you know, showing them the product, you can talk about a common alternative to that product. 

05:39 
If you're doing Alpha Grind, which is a caffeine, the coffee product, right, a common alternative would be Starbucks or Red Bull or something that gives you energy and attacking those things. 

05:46 
So before we dive into that straight away, again, going over it real quick, common mistakes, not seeking feedback on your content, bad lighting, background, quickly skimming through the pain points and the benefits. 

05:53 
Those are the things you really want to focus on and explain well. 

05:55 
Death-based videos, awkward silences, and too silly, showing products too quickly in the video. 

05:57 
You want to build up to it. 

05:58 
So all pretty simple to fix things. 

06:01 
But yeah, now let's dive into things that are working in these videos and things that you can apply in your stuff. 

06:06 
So what's working for people? 

06:09 
Same product that you guys are running right now. 

06:10 
So like I just said, attacking common alternatives to your product. 

06:13 
The more popular the alternative is, the better. 

06:15 
So like we said, for, is it just going to get a lot quieter? 

06:19 
Yeah, maybe that's the way my laptop is. 

06:28 
So I'm not rambling on while you guys can't hear me. 

06:33 
Like I said, attacking common alternatives to your product. 

06:35 
The more popular the alternative, the better. 

06:37 
So example, a common alternative to Alphagrind would be Starbucks or Red Bull. 

06:39 
A common alternative to Kingdip would be Zin. 

06:41 
Or a common alternative to, you know, just anything. 

06:42 
What's something that, for the product, for the problem that your product solves, what's 

06:48 
So in that example, right, she's talking about a tanning supplement or the tan-match product. 

06:52 
That video that I showed you, she's attacking tanning meds, which is good because that's 

06:54 
a common thing that people use to get tan. 

06:58 
She's showing a clip explaining why it's so bad. 

06:59 
So attack these common alternatives. 

07:02 
So I kind of showed you the one example earlier, but she just did a great job of explaining 

07:04 
And I'll show you another example here from SB.
