00:00 
for alpha grind for her loss it might be tougher but maybe for a fragrance it could be just another 

00:04 
fragrance right what's the more i feel like i see those videos all the time with uh like cologne 

00:07 
products on tiktok shop if you just find a more expensive cologne um and just use that as your 

00:11 
against right like this you know this is a pheromone cologne they cost four hundred dollars 

00:13 
versus yours that's better and it's called the fraction of the price so just something it might 

00:16 
not i can't be it might not always be crystal clear right like starbucks or rebel for energy 

00:19 
product or din compared to a caffeine pouch or whatever but you know sometimes you gotta think 

00:23 
a little more creative so yeah for her loss maybe more expensive cologne that is you know the common 

00:25 
alternative for alpha grind maybe it's right starbucks rebel for kingmaker you know maybe 

00:28 
it's steroids or trainer or an expensive gym or i don't know like sometimes you just gotta think 

00:32 
a little bit about uh about these things but yeah attacking common alternative tools or products 

00:35 
definitely something i've seen a lot consistently worth like it's just a comparing your product 

00:38 
another product here's why mine is better and this one is so much work uh so just consistently 

00:40 
works um now the next one i'm excited about this one so this is mia's account so she uses 

00:43 
unique hooks like it's not like okay i saw a viral video and i just took the hook and i just 

00:46 
redid it with that hook um she did a really unique hook which we'll dive into i'm gonna do these kind 

00:49 
of points together because it's all right it's all referencing the same video so unique hooks 

00:52 
and educating the viewer about the product so let me just show you the video and also this is 

00:56 
talking head style just be yourself right like mia who i spoke 

00:58 
to right before this she gave me this video she said this before sydney said this like 

01:01 
it's really great creators when you're doing talking head style like just talk as if you're 

01:03 
talking to your best friend already you're not trying to sound super professional she's not 

01:05 
trying to sound like anything other than who she is so unique hook educate you or be yourself let 

01:08 
me show you the video i'm talking about right here so it's real quick she said if you're 

01:14 
listening up your pheromone balance is off um so you're definitely not a hook that i've seen 

01:17 
for her loss like she's just being silly like if you're pussless listen up your pheromone 

01:20 
balance is off and she kind of goes into educating about pheromones and educating let me show you 

01:28 
so this is crazy yeah that's facts um yeah so this is how i think and she was telling me this 

01:38 
when she sent me the video she's like i feel like this kind of script would only really work for 

01:40 
women or for a really really confident man like you saw you probably can't be talking about like 

01:43 
you need to come across like you get hella women if you're using that kind of script but what is 

01:49 
she doing right she's educating the consumer on pheromone versus just a regular cologne like you 

01:52 
need to speak to one you don't need to speak to a woman no you need to speak to her you know 

01:54 
however she's educating and again like i'll share the notion with you guys so you guys will have all 

01:58 
of this uh but yeah right what does she do she uses a unique kind of uh she's a unique hook like 

02:03 
not everybody i haven't seen anybody talk about it you're pussless or whatever it's kind of funny 

02:05 
you have to do a little bit um and speak to the main people that cologne and pheromone should do 

02:09 
like you're trying to get more you're trying to get more play you're trying to get more girls if 

02:11 
you're you know trying to you're buying a pheromone cologne as a man that's what it's supposed to do 

02:14 
so we're kind of doing all the things and she's just being herself like she's not being stiff 

02:16 
she's not like kind of talking like she feels like she needs to talk like she's just talking 

02:18 
like she's talking to her friend like yeah um she's just being herself and also the copybook 

02:28 
the video cheat code it's a voodoo magic it's just why it's just different it's just unique 

02:31 
it's her own stuff um so i think it's a great account that you did you're running her loss 

02:35 
and again it's probably a better value for her loss like a girl would know what a girl wants 

02:38 
a girl would know what a girl is attracted to so it's kind of easier angle for them but if you're 

02:40 
a guy you know again you can try to if you're younger if you don't really look like you get 

02:43 
a lot of girls or whatever it is you can talk about you know you can try to make whatever 

02:45 
you're about to say uh validated by an authority um you know we spoke about this before like uh 

02:49 
that that goalie campaign where he's like oh my dad is the highest paid doctor like that's another 

02:52 
way to make it look like make whatever you're about to say next sound more valid by giving 

02:54 
somebody else that authority uh my dad worked at a you know working in within the fragrance 

02:58 
industry for 30 years or i worked at macy's for three years and here's what you know like 

03:00 
something right like make whatever you're about to say more valid by you know giving yourself that 

03:03 
authority um so yeah so those are a couple things with that video specifically um again you'll have 

03:07 
access to the notion so you can look at all the rest of the videos and all the rest of these 

03:09 
videos and all these accounts um now the next one is really interesting um tap into the thought and 

03:12 
idea that people already believe that people already kind of have this notion of like um 

03:15 
i'll show you the video now and i'll talk more about it so tap into thoughts and ideas that 

03:18 
people already beat so let's look at the video load up all right 

03:22 
you 

03:24 
all right so he said why did nobody tell me that working at a hospital everybody is horny like i 

03:28 
feel like that's just a common conception that people have i don't know if you guys heard that 

03:30 
like i've definitely heard that like nurses and people that work at hospitals are just you know 

03:32 
they're always cheating on their spouse they're always you know doing some crazy shit um so this 

03:35 
is a concept that i learned recently like from a book called all marketers tell stories if you 

03:38 
haven't read that um definitely check it out but it's talking about like there's ideas and beliefs 

03:41 
that people already have and when you talk about those ideas and beliefs that people already believe 

03:44 
in it's so much easier to kind of tell them whatever you're about to tell them so in this 

03:47 
video he's starting it all talking about how why did nobody tell me that people in hospitals are 

03:49 
already are always horny so whatever else he says the comments i'm sure in this video are talking 

03:52 
about that like it's something that people are gonna be like you know think as they're watching 

03:54 
it like yo where like they definitely are somebody has a story about they dated another nurse and 

03:57 
whatever like people will dive in the comments talking about that and it boosts your engagement 

03:59 
um but you also see this a lot with green screen videos when they're you know building a conspiracy 

04:02 
about a certain person or building a conspiracy around a certain industry like people already 

04:04 
hold these beliefs about these industries and about these you know polarizing figures and when 

04:07 
you talk about it automatically they're believing what you're saying because they already believe in 

04:10 
it so using that in your products i think this is a he does it in a really interesting way why 

04:13 
did nobody like he this is a her loss video uh so he did a really creative way to kind of bring 

04:17 
in an already existing belief and then get into the product and watch the rest of the video 

04:35 
yeah so he does a couple of really good things in this video aside from uh just talking about 

04:58 
an idea i believe that people already have which is the whole hospital thing one he's wearing 

05:00 
scrubs which makes it look more authentic he's probably not a nurse like i've been seeing a lot 

05:03 
of people do this they buy scrubs on amazon for i don't know 20 bucks 30 bucks 40 bucks i have no 

05:05 
idea um but it just makes you come across as more authentic whether you're talking about a supplement 

05:07 
whether you're talking about in this video you're talking about how you work at a hospital so it 

05:10 
looks more authentic um or yeah like i said if you're talking about a supplement you're wearing 

05:13 
a nurse's gear and you're wearing a scrub when you start talking about medical stuff it just 

05:15 
looks like you know more because you come across as an authority figure that's something they talk 

05:17 
about in cash advertising um where a lot of companies like on commercials like before tiktok 

05:21 
and everything they would just have an actor come on with like a white uh a white jacket on to make 

05:24 
them look like a doctor and it just automatically becomes more believable because it looks like 

05:26 
you're taking advice from a doctor whether they are or aren't so this video is wearing scrubs but 

05:28 
in other videos people are wearing scrubs talking about whatever product so maybe you guys can test 

05:31 
that out um in your videos as well but yeah he does a couple of really good things there 

05:33 
the having into belief that people already have um the scrub adding more authenticity to his story 

05:37 
um which you guys can do in different ways maybe you're talking about how you're trying to pick up 

05:40 
a girl in school and you have a school behind you you have a campus behind you you have your 

05:42 
book bag on you have like your notebook or something right like props in your video that 

05:44 
can validate your story with it make it seem more authentic um or how you pick up a girl at 

05:47 
starbucks and have your starbucks up in hand or whatever the case is um so little things like 

05:49 
that i'll keep in mind um we're almost done here and yeah so like i was saying uh in the common 

05:53 
mistake i see building up uh sorry i keep i keep on my sense yeah but building up to plugging the 

05:57 
product so instead of just shoving the product in their face you build up to it um you have a 

06:00 
story behind it you have like you did there and the last one we just saw as well right you tell 

06:02 
the full story and that's a very very end after you've got our attention we're following the 

06:04 
story and we're like we're commenting we're not with the hospital that was crazy or whatever then 

06:07 
you plug the product i have another example here i was trying to build up to it tells a story and 

06:09 
then at the very end brings uh let's see maybe the video's not available all right so that video's 

06:14 
not available but this one was a great example of it nonetheless right he tells the story he gets 

06:14 
This one was a great example of it nonetheless. 

06:16 
us he gets us involved he gets us interested and then at the end after after bringing us in after 

06:20 
getting us involved in the story he brings up the product um this one again i'll send you the 

06:22 
notes so you might be able to have it over but 

06:27 
it makes you imagine yourself 

06:34 
a whole play-by-play there 

06:46 
about how she's not 

06:47 
a naturally tanned person 

07:00 
and nobody wants to be told 

07:03 
and when you build up 

07:08 
that shows the effects 

07:18 
and plenty of the show 

07:32 
things I have for you 

07:38 
and more stuff 

07:45 
And you're wondering, sorry, let me pull this chat up. 

07:55 
Chat, tell the dreamies to roll up, just keep on doing anything. 

07:56 
That caption's crazy, so we don't have point effects.
