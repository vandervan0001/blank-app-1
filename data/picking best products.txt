All right. What's up? So in this video, I'll be talking about picking a product for TikTok shop affiliates. 

00:14 
OK, a few key things here. This video should be pretty quick here. So pick an already proven product. Right. 

00:20 
So when you go on TikTok shop, you can look at the listing that has over 10K, 10,000, 10,000 units sold, which it'll say right there. 

00:30 
Then that's that's a proven product. Right. It's already got a bunch of sales. It's doing really well. 

00:34 
And, you know, that's a good sign. So pick anything over 10K sold is the first thing. 

00:39 
Second thing, problem solving. It makes it very, very easy to sell. 

00:43 
And when you're making your videos, if it's kind of like a problem solution type product. Right. 

00:48 
So I have bad skin. This will fix my skin. I have low energy. This will give me more energy. 

00:52 
I have a problem sleeping. This will help me sleep at night. 

00:56 
Like these type of problem solving things makes it very, very easy to sell. 

00:59 
And very, very like there's a lot of demand, like people will buy it. 

01:04 
Right. Because it's going to fix something in their life. So, yeah. 

01:07 
Three best niches, which kind of ties back to the problem solving is supplements and health. 

01:12 
This is what all my students, every all my friends that I know crushing it with TikTok shop are in this niche, which is just supplements and health. 

01:19 
And I'm going to show you some examples in a second here. Last thing, which is very, very important. 

01:24 
Good commission. So typically the normal commission is 20 percent and 20 percent is solid like that. 

01:31 
That's a good commission. Anything below that I would avoid. 

01:34 
And anything above that is really good. So I've seen some five, 10 percent commission. 

01:39 
I would probably avoid those. I would really shoot for at least 20 percent. 

01:43 
But I know some people getting 30, even 40 percent. And if you can get it up to there, you're going to be printing like you're going to be making a lot of money. 

01:51 
One thing is you can start at 20 percent after you generate a bunch of money. 

01:55 
You can always hit up the the the TikTok shop, whoever you're whatever product you're selling. 

02:01 
You can message them directly. And hey, hey, could I get an increase in? 

02:04 
My commission, I generated you guys one hundred thousand dollars in sales. Right. 

02:08 
So that's something you can do. I know some people that have done that. 

02:11 
So here's some examples of kind of the type of products that I know all my students and my friends are crushing it with right now. 

02:20 
Number one, the CMOS and Shilajit. 

02:22 
These are kind of like all-in-one supplements. 

02:24 
It's like a – you're basically like this is the – just take this supplement and it will cover all your bases, like that type of thing, which is really, really good for selling, right? 

02:34 
Like you can see the appeal there, right? 

02:36 
Instead of having a whole cabinet of supplements, just take these, blah, blah, blah. 

02:40 
It will give you more energy, more libido, blah, blah, blah, right? 

02:42 
All these benefits you can hit on. 

02:44 
The other one, magnesium. 

02:46 
This is a good one just for overall health, helping you sleep at night. 

02:49 
Like this one has 100,000 units sold. 

02:52 
I know people are making money with this. 

02:54 
Here's another one, five-day cleanse, like a gut and colon cleanse. 

02:59 
Almost 300,000 sold, right? 

03:00 
Like this thing sells like crazy. 

03:03 
I actually don't know many people that are crushing it with this product right now. 

03:06 
I know people personally that are doing these. 

03:08 
But I think some of you guys, especially girls, I think if you're a girl doing this, this would be a good product to try. 

03:15 
It's obviously very, very proven. 

03:17 
So that's it for this. 

03:19 
That's everything you need to know when it comes to picking products. 

03:22 
So I will see you guys in the next video where we talk about actually making videos and going viral, generating that cash.
