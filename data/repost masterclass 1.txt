00:05 
That's a little reposting sauce. 

00:07 
This stuff is pretty simple. 

00:09 
But when I was reposting, you'd be surprised how many DMs I still got from people having questions, stuff like that. 

00:14 
So I try to go through this as quick as possible. 

00:18 
I try to make it as, I don't think it should have been this long, but I try to make it as detailed as I could. 

00:25 
That way there's no more questions. 

00:28 
So first, it's an easy way to start earning money. 

00:32 
But if you're in the Discord, there's no reason you're not making money right away. 

00:35 
First day, you know, first couple of days only takes a few minutes out of your day. 

00:46 
It's very simple. 

00:47 
It can help you save up to pay for Creator's Corner, which is what I did. 

00:50 
Do you see how tall he is? 

00:51 
If you don't have money while you're trying to get in, you know what I'm saying? 

00:54 
Also, it's good to make connections, which leads to more money and opportunities. 

00:56 
We'll see you in a couple of weeks. 

00:58 
that's if you're consistent and you do a good job for your clients you know what i'm saying 

01:01 
you don't miss post stuff like that slide two how much money did i make reposting 

01:14 
I'm not doing it anymore. I only kept one client that I'm still reposting for. 

01:19 
But when I was doing it consistently, I was making around $800 to $1,200 a month from having six to nine clients. 

01:31 
Now I make that from just one client alone that I kept. Bonuses can up your earnings for sure. 

01:44 
If your clients do offer bonuses, if you're getting results, they sometimes will offer more money to keep you. 

02:06 
you know what i'm saying uh one thing to keep in mind is reposting 

02:10 
basic so don't expect to make you know drop shipping money 

02:29 
it's just easy extra money for low effort manual 

02:36 
you work but can definitely put some money in your pocket that for sure helps out 

02:40 
for me this was my way to get into creators corner quicker 

02:45 
because um you know what i'm saying budget but uh with just reposting money alone i was able to cut 

02:51 
one or two days off from work that way i can focus on you know e-comm stuff stuff like that 

02:56 
have more time than myself so that's what i was able to do you know three i use reposting money 

03:02 
like i said to get into creators corner now now i've moved on from reposting 

03:06 
to content creation and i kept one of my clients because we got a good relationship 

03:10 
and he pays me good also pays me bonuses when we go viral so 

03:15 
i said uh this month alone i received around 1 000 from just um that one client as a bonus 

03:24 
plus my 200 retainer that he gives me so y'all can see why i kept that one person 

03:29 
um plus we had a good relationship you know so i kept them still reposting so you can definitely 

03:36 
make some extra bread if you're consistent with your clients and you communicate and you have 

03:40 
good relationships with them like i said everyone needs a reposting and everyone can benefit from it 

03:47 
so you can definitely get clients for sure uh where to get clients in the opportunities channel 

03:55 
in the collective discord when you do a good job for clients sometimes those lead to more clients 

03:59 
they will plug you into more opportunities with people they know that need reposters excuse me 

04:05 
and then you could also ask them if they have any people they may know that need reposters 

04:11 
i know i got connected with a lot more people just from people that i was already working with so 

04:16 
so yeah like i said i'm going to opportunities channel 

04:20 
right here we're in the opportunities channel 

04:24 
see right here this guy already he's looking for a reposter 

04:29 
what you can do is you can like his message 

04:32 
or you can speed it up message him hey bro still need a reposter 

04:41 
i'm us-based you know what i'm saying keep it simple 

04:47 
you can also um leave a message in the chat 

04:53 
um look at the repost 

04:59 
i'm us-based 

05:03 
like the message or dm you know something you send that just don't spam in here 

05:11 
um don't be spamming messages in here you know what i'm saying just drop it in once 

05:16 
every couple days if you want to speed it up do like i said look through the chat 

05:23 
every single one that you see that's looking for reposters just dm you're gonna get faster response 

05:25 
just dm you're gonna get faster response 

05:29 
just dm you're gonna get faster response like that so 

05:30 
like that so that's a quicker way to get responses is to 

05:33 
that's a quicker way to get responses is to just go through the list 

05:35 
just go through the list on your own and start messaging everybody 

05:37 
on your own and start messaging everybody that looks that needs reposters 

05:40 
that looks that needs reposters you get a lot more dms and quicker that 

05:42 
you get a lot more dms and quicker that way so 

05:44 
way so there's that 

05:46 
there's that slide number four 

05:48 
slide number four how to attain clients uh pretty much went 

05:51 
through that already message them dm them uh leave your message in the chat don't spam messages in 

05:59 
the chat just drop it once every couple days you know what i'm saying i pretty much described 

06:04 
everything tell them let them know that they're u.s based make sure you let them know that you're 

06:10 
u.s based or wherever you're at there's that and then uh how to charge so you can obviously you 

06:18 
know you're doing the work you make the prices obviously you can create your own prices but 

06:24 
you know i'm saying they have to be reasonable or you won't get hired obviously if you're 

06:28 
beating out rages with your prices they're not going to want to hire you obviously and also 

06:33 
don't charge too low or you'll end up using a lot of your time with a bunch of work to do each day 

06:39 
and barely making any money you know i'm saying don't be taking on people for 20 bucks and you 

06:45 
gotta do like four five 

06:48 
today and you got like seven of them bitches you know i'm saying so you don't want to do that 

06:54 
um same with taking on too many clients at a low rate like i just said i'm saving you guys time 

07:02 
and money by letting y'all know to not just take any client that offers you money make sure it 

07:07 
makes sense take on clients that are willing to work for your reasonable prices keep in mind and 

07:14 
some will even offer you more before you even tell them your prices so 

07:17 
just got to talk to them 

07:18 
like i said so you guys just take your time getting set up with clients for good 

07:24 
good pricing and you guys should be straight also um when you do start getting clients 

07:34 
use the notes app on your phone or use a notebook to keep track of clients 

07:40 
and payment details write down the dates you receive payment from the clients along with 

07:45 
payment amount so you know when to charge them and how much they're going to charge you 

07:48 
and when it comes a day or two before their due date just shoot them a reminder 

07:53 
to see if they want to continue working with you so that's pretty simple just keep track of
