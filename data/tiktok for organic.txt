00:10 
what's going on guys so in this video I kind of want to just touch on you know 

00:15 
everything that goes into 

00:20 
I see a lot of people blaming their product for the reason that they're not having success. 

00:28 
Like, oh, this didn't work for me. 

00:30 
I couldn't get it to go viral. 

00:32 
Or I got it to go viral, got no conversions. 

00:35 
I'll just move on to another product, blah, blah, blah. 

00:37 
And yeah, sometimes I guess maybe it could be your product. 

00:39 
But I think the majority of the time you're not realizing that there's more that goes into it than just the product. 

00:42 
And these are the four things I think you need to master to sort of convert at an extremely high level. 

00:46 
Yes, you want a product that has demand. 

00:48 
It's eye-catching, blah, blah, blah, problem-solving. 

00:52 
Like, all those obvious things I went over in another video. 

00:55 
And it's not just about can I go viral, can I get this product in front of people's eyes. 

00:58 
If you really want to convert, you have to understand the type of content you make plays a huge factor. 

01:02 
is is it extremely obvious to the audience that you are the creator of that product and you're 

01:05 
selling that product uh like if they don't a lot of these videos you'll come across it's like 

01:09 
i'll watch the video and it's like it's not obvious that you're selling a product it almost 

01:13 
seems like you're just consumer showing the product you're talking about the product and 

01:15 
people are just gonna scroll because they don't even think you're selling that so that's number 

01:17 
one is like coming off as a business coming off as like um this is my product that i own this is 

01:21 
my you know my small business whatever that i sell this product and secondly i would say uh having 

01:26 
some sort of professional content right yes like all the inappropriate stuff can go viral but at 

01:30 
the end of the day if you can go viral without that inappropriate stuff and really um make your 

01:34 
content seem professional you're going to convert it way better uh so you know filming you know 

01:39 
filming in some shitty bedroom that's a mess uh versus filming in like an office area that's very 

01:43 
nice lighting and professional like what do you think is going to convert what is what are people 

01:45 
going to trust more right and a lot of this is about trust because you don't buy you don't buy 

01:48 
from someone you don't trust right so you have to take that in consideration as well and then you 

01:52 
know some other things like ctas and blah blah blah all that other stuff that goes into content 

01:55 
as well but it is very important the angles that you that you make your content from and stuff like 

02:00 
website this is an obvious one i don't really touch on it too much just having a well-branded 

02:03 
website i'm going to show you guys i have two examples pulled up up here that i'm going to 

02:05 
go through and show you their whole funnel step by step 

02:07 
And I'll go over these four things and talk about how well I think they did at all four of these. 

02:12 
But, yeah, so website, you want to have a well-branded website that looks clean, you know, has GIFs, description, reviews, all that stuff. 

02:16 
Don't pull up some – don't just have some shitty website that has, you know, horrible copying or reviews, stuff like that, and expect to convert, okay? 

02:22 
You might want to pay someone to do it for you or just, you know, get really good at it yourself. 

02:25 
Offer, this is the one I think I need to talk about the most, which I see you guys struggling with, like, more than anything. 

02:31 
And I think the problem is a lot of these kids doing TikTok organic these days never really learned direct response marketing. 

02:38 
They just kind of hopped into this whole TikTok content going viral, getting sales thing. 

02:41 
They didn't go through – you know, I sort of went through these three years of, like, Facebook ads and, like, online marketing, paid advertising. 

02:45 
I was never very successful at it, but I did learn a lot. 

02:46 
And one thing I learned a lot about was direct response marketing, which basically means getting someone who sees your ad for the first time to purchase right there, right? 

02:53 
So, like, they see your ad, they click your website, they make a purchase. 

02:55 
And there's a lot that goes into that, not just, hey, here's my product, go buy it. 

02:58 
And one of the big things that, like, I've learned. 

03:01 
I've learned from direct response marketing is having a unique offer, which is something that people feel like sort of, like, they're getting a steal. 

03:05 
They're getting, like, a really good deal, and it's unique compared to, you know, maybe your competition or Amazon, stuff like that. 

03:09 
Like, Amazon, yeah, you go to Amazon, find the product. 

03:11 
It might be 20% off, 50% off, whatever. 

03:14 
Like, that's a little discount or whatever. 

03:15 
But if you have something that's unique, like buy one, get one free, or each order comes with a free gift, or, you know, buy three, get one free, something that's more unique that people, like, it stands out, right? 

03:23 
That's one thing I see a lot of people struggling with and missing out on. 

03:25 
So let's take a look at a couple of these examples. 

03:27 
But, yeah, these are the four things I think you need to master to really convert extremely well with TikTok Organic and really squeeze, like, every last sale out of your audience. 

03:33 
I see people that master these that have 10,000 followers and are getting more sales than people that have 200,000 followers that just have holes in their funnel. 

03:39 
Like, they might have good content that goes viral, but their website's shit, their offer's shit, product's not that great, or even if the product's good, it might still not convert because they're screwing up these other two things. 

03:46 
So, yeah, anyways, let's take a look at this stuff. 

03:48 
Yeah, so this example I think is pretty good. 

03:50 
They kind of hit on their content's pretty solid. 

03:52 
It looks somewhat professional, you know, good lighting, clean. 

03:54 
You know, it is kind of, like, in the lawn, in the grass, so it's not top. 

03:57 
It's not the line, but it at least looks clean. 

03:59 
And one thing I noticed is they are kind of portraying that this is their product. 

04:01 
product you've been waiting for our newest 

04:04 
See, our newest two-in-one pro bottle account. 

04:05 
So right there, the audience is like, okay, this is a store that's selling this product, right? 

04:07 
So if they're interested in the product, they're going to click to your account, 

04:09 
and they're going to buy, you know, they might buy from you 

04:11 
because you're making it obvious that you're selling the product. 

04:12 
finally get to mix my chocolate and strawberry milk. They will never miss. 

04:16 
I finally get to mix my chocolate. 

04:17 
See, this is a good example, or a bad example. 

04:17 
See, this is a good example of a bad example. 

04:20 
If you come across this on your 40 page, you're not going to even see it. 

04:20 
If you come across this on your 40 page. 

04:22 
You're not going to even think, as a consumer, you're not going to think, like, oh, this is the source on your site, right? 

04:24 
I think, like, oh, this is the source. 

04:26 
You just think, oh, this is some random person that makes pounds of products and makes their chocolate milk, whatever, right? 

04:29 
So this isn't going to, like, bring very many visitors to your website. 

04:32 
And plus, they didn't have a CTA. 

04:33 
I guess this caption is a small CTA, but it's not going to catch everyone, right? 

04:33 
I guess there's actually all kinds of stuff. 

04:37 
So, yeah, that's kind of that. 

04:39 
Content, TikTok account, I like this bio, everything's branded decently well. 

04:43 
And then, you know, short, clean link here. 

04:45 
So, you know, we're talking about offers. 

04:46 
I think this is a decent offer. 

04:48 
It's better than the typical 50% off or 80% off, blah, blah, blah, that bullshit. 

04:51 
It's a little bit unique, but I still, you know, I don't think it's top of the line by any means. 

04:58 
If you could figure out those margins and that pricing, it would be a little bit better. 

05:03 
So right away, all the colors match, which I'm a big fan of, which plays a big part in branding. 

05:07 
Clean logo, they have their offer right here, which is good. 

05:12 
Some gifts, benefits, really professional-looking image here, and reviews. 

05:17 
But, yeah, this is a pretty solid website. 

05:20 
I think this viral summer flash sale with emojis, this is kind of spammy and dropshippy. 

05:24 
It doesn't really, I wouldn't see a seven, eight-figure, nine-figure, like, these big brands doing this. 

05:28 
You wouldn't see them doing viral summer flash sale, right? 

05:30 
Like, you're not going to see that on Nike's website. 

05:33 
This kind of looks, like, spammy. 

05:39 
They got some of the branding down, so I'll give it that. 

05:40 
But, yeah, so let's take a look at the fourth thing. 

05:42 
So products, you know, I'm not really too sure how this product converts. 

05:45 
I'm not sure what the demand is for this, so we'll just skip that for now. 

05:48 
But content, I'll give them, you know, it's pretty good. 

05:50 
They make it obvious they're selling a product a lot of the time. 

05:55 
But, you know, obviously things could be improved, right, if they really want to convert at the highest level. 

05:58 
So let's look at the second example. 

06:00 
First of all, this TikTok account looks extremely good and branded. 

06:06 
It also matches with the cloud word here. 

06:07 
This whole thing looks very clean and branded. 

06:09 
And the content seems to be very product-focused, which is good for converting. 

06:21 
Share this video and comment, and if your comment gets zero likes in 12 hours, we'll send you a pair. 

06:26 
Giveaway stuff isn't going to help you at all. 

06:28 
Yeah, at least it's very product-focused. 

06:32 
I think it's like small business vibes, which is really good. 

06:33 
People like that. 

06:36 
I think they could improve on it a little bit, but at least it's product-focused, and 

06:40 
they actually gave off the idea that this is their business a lot of the times. 

06:43 
But let's look at the website and their offer. 

06:45 
So yeah, their offer seems to just be another flash sale, $10 off, pretty boring stuff. 

06:53 
So I think they could improve on the offer, maybe, instead of just a flash sale like everyone 

06:58 
I don't know exactly what they could do. 

06:59 
Maybe like a buy one, get one free, but that might be hard with these sort of margins. 

07:03 
You could get a free cloud keychain or free cloud stuffed animal, tiny little thing, something 

07:06 
like that, to kind of make it more unique. 

07:08 
But every store I get is not going to have the greatest opportunity for a unique offer, 

07:12 
but it is something you guys should always try to look into and see if you can provide 

07:15 
But yeah, overall, pretty good funnel. 

07:16 
They kind of cover these first three pretty well, I'd say, other than the offer isn't 

07:20 
too unique. 

07:22 
But yeah, that's kind of it for today's video, guys. 

07:23 
I hope this kind of helped them sort of this idea of like, oh, it's all the product's fault. 

07:26 
I have to move on to the next product. 

07:28 
But make sure you kind of master all four of these things before you come to me like 

07:31 
explaining or complaining like, hey, none of my traffic's converting, or I'm not getting 

07:36 
I know I didn't touch too much on product criteria and good product converts, but I 

07:51 
If you want some more info on that. 

07:52 
But yeah, I hope this was helpful. 

07:53 
And I'll see you guys in the next video.
