Alright guys, so this is a video talking about how you actually get to Crossover Town, so... 

00:10 
We'll see you next time. 

00:13 
This is how to get to the top of the world. 

00:38 
I don't know what to do. 

00:40 
I don't know what to do. 

00:42 
1,000 followers on your account. 

00:45 
Well, we've been together for a long time, we know each other. 

00:51 
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. 

00:51 
stop talking 

00:53 
stop 

00:55 
stop 

00:57 
you are not going to stop 

00:59 
stop 

01:01 
stop 

01:02 
Let's get this over with. 

01:03 
you are not going to stop 

01:05 
stop 

01:06 
And so you don't want to go right now. 

01:10 
I don't know. 

01:14 
I don't understand what you're saying! 

01:16 
I don't understand what you're saying! 

01:17 
La-la-la. 

01:23 
It's true that I was in a live interview, but I don't know where it was, especially at 

01:29 
this time of the day. 

01:30 
Did you know that people in Paris don't have access to the information? 

01:36 
Like, I don't know, but he's in that room now. 

01:39 
Hello? 

01:41 
He's in that room now. 

01:43 
He'll have it fixed. 

01:44 
So he's been in the room, and I don't know where he is at all. 

01:46 
So, typically, you need to have a basic application for Passport. 

01:50 
Normally, you just go to Passport. 

01:52 
And it's very well looking for an international person. 

01:55 
So, you have to make sure you have an application. 

01:58 
You have to make sure you have an application added. 

02:01 
Bear in mind, this doesn't affect any chapter. 

02:05 
But all these accounts, the usual structure is you would join, you know, one of the servers. 

02:12 
We'll have prices. 

02:13 
You can get a 5 paper for $60 or $280. 

02:16 
And they might be different prices. 

02:18 
any other server that you saw. 

02:20 
this one, right? 

02:22 
Prices are, you know, $300 each for, like, a 5K, whereas for this one, it's, like, $260 or $280. 

02:29 
Now, they'll also all have different terms, right? 

02:32 
So when you're looking at FAQ or the terms in each server, they might have different policies. 

02:36 
They might have different policies. 

02:38 
So it would be important that you're not just looking at pricing. 

02:38 
point that you're not supposed to be in. 

02:40 
Something might have cheaper prices. 

02:42 
because they don't offer refunds so make sure that you're looking beforehand do they have a refund 

02:47 
policy how long is the policy for so for instance this seller has a five-day refund policy 

02:52 
Thank you. 

02:53 
Other sellers, they might have like a one. 

02:53 
For other sellers, they might have like a one-week mark on it. 

02:55 
So, for instance, this cell has a 14-day... 

02:59 
So you won't get refunded, but you'll get a discount. 

03:00 
I don't know what I'm doing. 

03:02 
So maybe you would rather work with them. 

03:04 
Okay 

03:08 
Now, you also have to ensure that the refund policy is not just a blanket policy. 

03:11 
I don't like it. 

03:13 
Thank you very much. 

03:14 
we'll have a closer look at it from any videos. 

03:17 
or they'll say if you got bad um so make sure you're asking questions 

03:23 
That's a good one, that's a good one. 

03:23 
What do you mean? I'm not going to... 

03:26 
And most importantly, that I pay for all their... 

03:29 
So typically to pay, you'll go, you'll have some sort of ticket system. 

03:33 
This is usually the same for all of them. 

03:34 
You can check out the pricing, you can check out the ethics. 

03:37 
Once you actually want to go to order, you open a ticket. 

03:39 
Once you open that ticket, you tell them how many accounts you want and what type of account. 

03:44 
Do you want a U.S. audience account? 

03:46 
Do you want an international audience account? 

03:48 
Typically, U.S. audience will have better results but will be more expensive. 

03:51 
verified it'll have some information it's more expensive 5k versus 10k right there's a bunch of 

03:58 
different options typically when you're starting i would say go for a 5k account that's already 

04:02 
verified and it can be usa or international it doesn't really matter um open the ticket tell 

04:09 
them which ones you want and then pay they're gonna have a different payment scheme like it 

04:12 
might be a stripe a paypal link crypto whatever else once you pay then make sure that you change 

04:18 
the information on the account this is the most important part as soon as you get the account 

04:22 
sign in immediately remove all of the devices from the account change the email change the 

04:28 
phone number change the password make sure that you're changing all the information and there 

04:33 
often will be videos on this account already because typically when they're getting to 5,000 

04:38 
followers they're doing that by posting videos now you don't want to delete those videos and 

04:43 
spam delete them you want to archive them or leave the videos up now you can mass 

04:48 
them or you can just do it one by one either way i just would not mass delete the videos that 

04:53 
usually serves as a red flag for tiktok and then typically as after you've signed in you change all 

04:58 
the information 

04:59 
Then, just make sure that the refund policy, the replacement policy, all those terms are specified ahead of time. 

05:05 
I cannot tell you how many people will buy an account, think that there's a blanket refund policy, and then, you know, a month later, the account gets banned, and they go back, and then they're like, wow, the supplier won't give me an account. 

05:16 
You just didn't read the terms and conditions, right? 

05:18 
Now, again, this isn't like you're downloading an app from the App Store, and its terms and conditions are, you know, insanely wrong. 

05:24 
Like, it's literally five questions. 

05:40 
Just make sure, because different suppliers will have different refunds, different pricing, different accounts, so you can have a different account. 

05:48 
We give you two to four options of suppliers so that you can choose yourself. 

05:54 
I'm not just saying that all of them have to be good, but, again, we don't make any money. 

05:59 
So make sure you're reading the terms. 

06:01 
Make sure you're changing all the account information. 

06:03 
Make sure you're talking in the chat with the ticket. 

06:06 
Don't ghost the person, then come back a month later, right? 

06:08 
You've got to use your head for this. 

06:10 
There are cases where, you know, they might not come up to their terms. 

06:14 
It might say in their terms and conditions, you know, it's 14 days. 

06:16 
You hit the MAC after 12 days and they still won't give you your refund. 

06:19 
In that case, you know, you can feel free to DM me. 

06:22 
I'm Luca right here. 

06:26 
In the server, in all these Discord servers as well. 

06:29 
So send me a DM if there are issues. 

06:31 
But if you are within their policy and they're not giving you a refund, I can help you out. 

06:35 
If you're within, if you're outside of their policy and you hit them up two months later, 

06:38 
I'm going to say sorry, like you're out of luck, right? 

06:41 
So it's up to you to do your own due diligence. 

06:43 
And then if there are any issues, you get scammed, just let me know. 

06:46 
Beyond that, I think you should be good to go. 

07:00 
Thank you for watching. 

07:09 
Step-by-step tutorial on the same 

07:14 
important. If you are not in the U.S., you need to do this to make sure you target a U.S. audience 

07:22 
because that is who we are marketing to. If you reside in the U.S. full-time, 

07:27 
You do not need to watch this video. 

07:28 
It's dead! It's dead! 

07:31 
It's dead! 

07:38 
What? 

07:42
