00:02 
Yo, what's up? It's Cal here. 

00:03 
So in this video, I'm basically going to be going over all the different types of TikTok shop content, right? 

00:10 
And I'm not going to go super in-depth on each one, but I'm going to kind of break down the main key points and show you some examples for each one. 

00:16 
And you guys can kind of get an idea of which one you want to test yourself, depending on if you want to show your face or you don't want to show your face. 

00:25 
The cool thing about TikTok shop is there's a ton of different styles you can do. 

00:28 
And depending on who you are, you might want to pick one or the other. 

00:32 
Right. So let's get into it. 

00:34 
First things first, talking head, right? 

00:36 
Like this is this is the most popular style when it comes to TikTok shop. 

00:41 
A lot of the people I know, you know, Sydney, Luis, people that have done 100K months with this, a lot of them are doing the talking head style. 

00:49 
So the one thing with this is you do have to show your face. 

00:51 
But anyways, first things first, strong and wild hook like that. 

00:55 
You know, of course, you need a strong hook, you know, something a bit wild, shocking, whatever. 

01:00 
We have another video where. 

01:02 
We break this down a little bit more in depth, just hooks. 

01:04 
But anyways, that's the first thing. 

01:06 
And then second thing, you're going to kind of go into like storytelling. 

01:09 
And you want it to make, you want it to feel like you're on a FaceTime call with a friend or, you know, a family member. 

01:14 
Like it needs to feel very relatable, very real. 

01:17 
You know, you don't want it to be, you don't need to be all professional and scripted and stuff like this. 

01:22 
You want it to feel like you're talking to a friend, okay? 

01:26 
That's something to keep in mind. 

01:28 
And another thing I should mention is 60 second plots. 

01:31 
For whatever reason, these videos always seem to do well when they're longer, right? 

01:35 
Like 60 seconds, you know, two minutes, three minutes, some are even, you know, up to three minutes, which is crazy. 

01:41 
But they just, they perform so much better. 

01:43 
So try to make it at least 60 seconds. 

01:47 
It'll always perform better. 

01:49 
Last thing, CTA. 

01:50 
Of course, you want to have a call to action, you know, telling people where they can purchase and things like that. 

01:55 
We'll have another separate video breaking that down. 

01:57 
But let's pull up an example here and get into this. 

02:01 
I just finished getting them. 

02:02 
I have to show you guys a Sydney, uh, example from Sydney. 

02:06 
So this is one of the best videos you'll ever watch when it comes to talking 

02:10 
head, like literally study this. So this is for a body oil, but let's, 

02:15 
i just finished getting the best head of my entire life and i'm a hundred percent convinced that it 

02:20 
had nothing to do with my boyfriend it actually had to do with how good i smelled every time like 

02:25 
we would hang out like it would always be like fine but this time he was just like acting like 

02:29 
crazier i wore something different i did not wear the same thing that i did to switch it up okay 

02:35 
turn into a cannibal they were saying that it was gonna make your make my god the twisted neck 

02:40 
Okay, so this ended up being a minute and 45 seconds, right? 

02:44 
Like I said, a bit longer. 

02:46 
But yeah, I mean, she had a crazy hook, right? 

02:49 
I ended up, I just got the best head of my life, you know, shocking wild hook. 

02:53 
And then she goes into telling a story. 

02:55 
She's so good at making it feel real. 

02:57 
And like her storytelling is so good. 

03:00 
I mean, she's, you know, she's the best of the best. 

03:02 
But yeah, this is an example of talking head. 

03:05 
Let me show you another example here. 

03:08 
Let's pull up this one real quick. 

03:11 
as an esthetician for over 15 years. 

03:16 
Okay, so first of all, her hook here. 

03:19 
Esthetician for over 50 years, right? 

03:21 
She built that authority. 

03:22 
It's like, okay, she knows what she's talking about. 

03:25 
That's kind of her hook here, which I think is really, really good. 

03:29 
I'm a former New York City med spa owner. 

03:33 
And a former, you know, New York City, even more authority, right? 

03:37 
This is new, ahead of its time, and something that you absolutely must try. 

03:44 
Micro-needling without needles. 

03:46 
Right. So she goes straight into talking about the product and she does a great comparison here. 

03:51 
She's like, this is microneedling without the microneedling. This is a way easier, cheaper option than microneedling. 

03:57 
Like she's already talking about a bunch of benefits. So, yeah, another amazing talking head content or video. 

04:07 
This one ended up being two minutes long. Let me show you one more example here. 

04:11 
Then we'll move on to the next thing. Let's see. OK. 

04:16 
This is not my normal content, so I apologize in advance, but I have to share this with you. 

04:21 
I have bought these sunglasses right here five times since spring break. 

04:27 
First of all, she does a really good job of making this feel like I was saying, like just you're on a FaceTime call and she doesn't even have a great hook. 

04:35 
Right. Like it just feels so real. I feel like that that alone kind of pulls people. 

04:39 
Not because they've been misplaced, lost, broken, anything like that. 

04:43 
It's because I have four teenage daughters. 

04:45 
And then she just, you know, does a great job of kind of storytelling. 

04:48 
She goes on about how her 14-year-old daughters keep stealing these sunglasses, so she has to keep buying more, blah, blah, blah. 

04:54 
Ends up being a minute and 30 seconds. 

04:58 
Yeah, another great example. 

04:59 
But, like, that was a great example of how simple this can really be. 

05:02 
So next thing, AI videos, right? 

05:05 
So when you're creating an AI video, an eye-catching visual hook, this is huge. 

05:10 
You'll see in this example here. 

05:13 
You know, this is not like talking heads. 

05:15 
Like, this is something you want to be more technical about. 

05:18 
You're going to script out the video ahead of time. 

05:20 
You're going to, you know, clean AI images. 

05:24 
We do have an AI guide. 

05:26 
It's a channel in the Discord, so go there for more, you know, how exactly to do this. 

05:30 
But social proof, you'll see in this video. 

05:34 
I'll show that to you. 

05:35 
And then strong PTA, of course, like always, you know, telling people where to buy. 

05:40 
Here's some of the tools that I suggest for building or for making AI videos. 

05:46 
A great way to find viral videos to replicate. 

05:48 
Like, a lot of AI is just like finding already viral AI videos and kind of replicating them 

05:53 
and changing them slightly and making that your video, right? 

06:00 
This is the best way to make AI images. 

06:03 
Eleven Labs. 

06:04 
This is where you can get the voiceovers. 

06:06 
And then CapCut, where you can do your editing, your captions, transitions, all that sort of stuff, 

06:10 
which is also shown in the AI guide. 

06:13 
Let's pull up this example for you real quick. 

06:18 
This is what would happen if you started oil pulling every day. 

06:21 
First, you would notice... 

06:23 
Okay, so right away you see this is like a visual hook, right? 

06:30 
It grabs your attention, right? 

06:32 
So that your breath would start to smell significantly better. 

06:36 
This is because oil pulling can have similar effects as mouthwash. 

06:39 
Additionally, your teeth would also get whiter as the guru Nanda pulling oil has. 

06:44 
So now they're showing the product oils, which help remove yellow stains from your teeth and help keep your breath fresh for a longer period of time. 

06:46 
oils 

06:52 
I linked the best oil pulling brand in the bottom left corner of this video so you can start your journey to a better. 

06:59 
blah that's the pta but yeah i mean it i i wanted to use this example because this isn't even there 

07:06 
is much better ai videos out there than this right but this one is so simple and look at i mean it 

07:13 
did 231 000 likes right so this generated some money for sure but it's so simple that's why i 

07:19 
wanted to use this example because it doesn't have to be super complex right look at this like 

07:23 
some text some captions you know some clean ai images basic script you know just show the product 

07:30 
for a second cta that's all it takes man like it's crazy so that's it if you want to do ai videos 

07:38 
um like i said we have a guide on that and you know there's much more info in the discord 

07:44 
next voiceover so this is a really good another like good simple type of content you can make 

07:51 
Public service announcement. 

07:52 
This stuff is very public. 

07:54 
So this dial, we actually used to call this like the old head. 

07:57 
um it's a very
