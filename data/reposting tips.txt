00:00 
some things around that that you guys frequently ask me about 

00:13 
so let's get into it. Introduction. There's no reason you should not be reposting, guys. 

00:20 
Facebook and IG Reels and YouTube Shorts are such easy ways to get your content out to more 

00:25 
people, get more free views. It takes three minutes. 

00:29 
and, you know, no-brainer, right? 

00:31 
Like, people are like, oh, should I repost? 

00:33 
You just download it to TickSafe on SnapTick or whatever, 

00:36 
I should have added that in FAQs, to be honest, but whatever. 

00:39 
Download it with SnapTick or whatever HD downloader you can find 

00:43 
It takes three minutes a day, you know? 

00:44 
And if you just get in the habit of every single time you post, 

00:46 
you repost it, you know, it'll become, like, 

00:48 
taking no effort, right? 

00:49 
So everybody should be reposting, 

00:50 
especially when you're making good content. 

00:51 
It's just another chance to really get views on everything you do. 

00:53 
And TikTok is still the best place to make content, in my opinion. 

00:57 
And then you have IG Reels next. 

00:58 
Facebook Reels is really amazing for certain types of products, 

01:00 
And then YouTube Shorts, too. 

01:01 
And, God, I should have added another FAQ, too, about converting. 

01:04 
So here's some of the FAQs I get all the time about reposting. 

01:09 
Can I use reposting softwares? 

01:10 
So if you're doing mass volume or you have things that are, like, 

01:12 
way more worth your time, like you're not a creator, 

01:13 
you're not making your own content, you own a big brand, whatever, 

01:15 
definitely just hire a reposter. 

01:16 
They're, like, $100 to $200 a month to post, like, you know, 

01:18 
30 to 60 times or more across, you know, multiple channels. 

01:22 
Ideally, you want them to be in the U.S. 

01:23 
or if you're U.S.-based, or to have, like, just a U.S. SIM card 

01:25 
that, you know, makes sure they're targeting correctly. 

01:28 
I hire a ton of them. 

01:29 
You can also, like, get into affiliate stuff, too. 

01:30 
Like, if you have a really good product with viral content 

01:32 
where, you know, they can make money by just reposting content, 

01:35 
if anything blows up, they get to run their affiliate link. 

01:37 
We do that with our brands, but then again, we're not the normal brand. 

01:40 
good for everybody if you're a beginner and you're just starting out posting your own content you're 

01:42 
still making the tiktoks for your brands or your drop shipping stores repost it yourself that's 

01:43 
making the TikToks. 

01:46 
probably what i'd recommend it's good to like know what to do too and to like see commonalities and 

01:48 
stuff like that when you go about it yourself too um 

01:50 
As far as software goes, I don't really recommend any. 

01:52 
TikTok's API is not open, so, like, 

01:54 
and some of these other APIs are not open, too, 

01:55 
for, like, reposting, I feel like. 

01:57 
you're at heavier risk of getting shadow banned if you find one like repurpose.io maybe or something 

02:00 
like that and you like it and do it but i just feel like it's not the best look a lot of times 

02:03 
they use virtual phones which could mess up your targeting and stuff like that i don't know i'm 

02:06 
skeptical i personally just would recommend doing it manually or having someone else do it 

02:09 
warming up accounts this is a huge one um and definitely for some of these really matters so 

02:13 
for youtube shorts and uh facebook reels i think the only uh thing with that is just that like you 

02:17 
need to keep posting like there's not really ways to warm it up facebook you do it through your 

02:19 
personal account just look up how to make a facebook reels account online and you'll see 

02:22 
it's like a little complicated to be honest with you um with facebook reels too just an extra tip 

02:25 
i'm just throwing this out there i hope you're taking notes on this uh you can set up a business 

02:28 
style too which is basically go through your personal account you make a business page and 

02:31 
then you make the facebook reels account through that page that'll let you set up automations for 

02:41 
I don't know what's up with it. 

02:49 
It's not good. 

03:05 
It's not good. 

03:07 
It's not good. 

03:26 
people when they ask you questions what's weird about facebook is when they they can dm really 

03:29 
easily it's hard for people to find the link so when you make a business page just look this up 

03:36 
by the way like it's very simple if you just look up like a facebook business reels page you can uh 

03:40 
set it up via going through your personal make page and then set those automations or you can 

03:42 
just use a personal one some people find that personal ones do a little better views wise 

03:44 
um and they work really well for products for older people like uh in general facebook reels 

03:48 
is good for older people and that's fine too you just won't be able to set up automations and you'll 

03:51 
get like 3 000 dms um and just try to respond to as many as you can linking them to your website 

03:54 
uh but warming up accounts right doesn't really matter for facebook reels and youtube just you 

03:57 
just like really need a post ig though i've definitely found that it does matter um and so 

04:00 
what we typically recommend is for like the first two to three days just follow people like them 

04:05 
make yourself look like a normal account so like we'll tell people to follow like a bunch of like 

04:07 
suggested accounts like their pages blah blah blah like maybe like 50 to 100 just follow them 

04:11 
um like um sometimes do if it's like a brand we're running with and we have really good content 

04:14 
we'll like post like normal feed stuff even add some stories uh you know just make it look like 

04:18 
a normal brand page like it would be with a hundred thousand followers but it's obviously 

04:20 
no followers uh just make it look good and then post the reels to the just the real section 

04:24 
that being said not every time we'll do the post but we'll just pretty much typically always do 

04:27 
the following other accounts like scrolling on the page liking posts like being like a normal 

04:30 
instagram user and we've noticed that improves things and on top of that you definitely just 

04:34 
have to go through and post right like it's very typical on on ig reels sometimes facebook reels 

04:38 
sometimes youtube too for like the first like 10 posts to get no views like literally like 5 10 

04:41 
views it's very normal um and you just need to keep posting usually not the two three week mark 

04:44 
if your content's good it'll pick up right if your content's not good i mean like you can't 

04:47 
really expect anything and that leads me to my next question a lot of times i'll get people 

04:50 
um i'll get people asking me about um the difference in views i'll be like oh my god i 

04:54 
got a thousand views on tiktok or sorry i got 200 views on tiktok but i got a thousand on every 

04:57 
single ig reel i got 5 000 on youtube bro like expecting those views to be the same would be 

05:01 
absolutely fucking insane like why why would you expect those to be the same you know like i think 

05:04 
they'll correlate near each other like in all honesty i think 205 000 are not that big of a 

05:07 
difference um but that's like gonna happen all the time i'd say the baseline for youtube is like 

05:11 
very common to get 5 000 views a video like once your account is like you know getting some kind 

05:14 
of views that's kind of like the similar baseline to three to five hundred on tiktok and on reels 

05:17 
it can be anywhere from 300 to 500 to a thousand or more um so it's gonna vary like expect a 

05:21 
difference i don't know why you guys would expect it to be the same i'd say viral videos on tiktok 

05:24 
tend to go viral on reels especially if you post them enough um and your account's already warmed 

05:27 
up and all that like that's pretty typical it's like it's like one in four that they'll probably 

05:30 
go viral there too or videos i did decent will do decent there as well or if you just have content 

05:33 
that was really good didn't really hit the algo right on on tiktok you post on reels and it goes 

05:36 
crazy that's why you should just always be reposting everywhere there's another chance it 

05:39 
could go crazy if it doesn't go crazy on any of them over a large a large enough amount quantity 

05:42 
or a large enough quantity what's the sign there your content right so that's just like it's a good 

05:46 
way to know honestly too when your content is actually bad you're getting more volume so you 

05:49 
can actually see okay if i posted 30 videos on tiktok reposted all of them so i have 90 posts 

05:52 
out there 120 posts out there in general none of them did anything it's probably something i need 

05:55 
to improve with my product or my content or whatever you know the different pillars we talk 

05:57 
about right you see why that's so beneficial and should i be doing it even as a beginner i think 

06:00 
yes personally there's no downside to taking the extra few minutes of doing it uh that being said 

06:04 
it's definitely way more worth it the better your content's getting like if you're getting decent 

06:07 
views on tiktok where you really know how to make a good tiktok like right you have to be doing it 

06:10 
you have to you're just taking more shots right and you're putting your good content in front of 

06:13 
more chances of getting eyeballs like you got to do that so yes i would do it even as a beginner 

06:17 
because why not but as a as the better you get the more important it becomes right like a beginner 

06:20 
like your content still might suck you're just improving so you know you need to improve 

06:22 
um for the most part it's it's do it anyways but just keep that in mind better always um and just 

06:28 
get in the habit of doing it like i said like when i was when i was making my content i would always 

06:31 
like back when i was a creator i would always just post and my habit would be i'd immediately 

06:35 
download it on snapchat go to ig reels and you know whatever the other ones i want to use you 

06:38 
can also do pinterest but it doesn't convert that well um and i'll go over there and just 

06:41 
repost them there and that's actually another faq i want to add here about um converting well 

06:44 
so with converting it really depends it really really depends sometimes on ig reels it'll convert 

06:49 
like amazingly sometimes it'll convert like shit just expect it to be all over the place 

06:52 
and of course apply basic rules of like the converting pillars try to plug in your link 

06:56 
wherever you can like on on youtube shorts a lot of people will put it in the comments and then pin 

06:59 
it um on ig reels people will just put in their their caption maybe they'll pin the comment they'll 

07:03 
respond to a bunch of comments it's the same principles as everywhere else conversions vastly 

07:06 
differ everywhere though facebook reels sometimes go stupid for us with like older products like 

07:09 
supplements um and doesn't do shit for younger products like my school swimwear brand and stuff 

07:12 
so keep that in mind uh but yeah get out of doing it just do it automatically and you'll be good 

07:15 
and just be consistent with it people are like oh i reposted it to get any views you post five 

07:18 
fucking videos dude post fucking 30 40 50 100 right you have to be consistent enough with volume 

07:22 
there's that warming up period that you have to get past and then the better content you make 

07:24 
everything will always get easier right it's just like tiktok make better content and more content 

07:28 
and everything will be better cheers hope this was helpful and you guys crush it with your repost
