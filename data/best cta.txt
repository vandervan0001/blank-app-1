Yo, it's good. 

00:11 
Yo, it's good. 

00:17 
It's good. So I'm sure you guys have all heard how important CTAs, also known as call to actions, are for your TikTok videos. 

00:26 
So I wanted to make a quick video. It's kind of going over. I have like five different ways here. 

00:31 
The best way to completely optimize your chances of getting clicks to your website. 

00:36 
So we're going to go through some examples. Let's get right into this, though. It should be quick. 

00:40 
So first of all, one of the most simple, basic ways that has worked for years now, people have been doing it, is just adding a quick link in bio text at the end of your video. 

00:52 
So we got an example here. Link to shop is in our bio. Right. 

00:57 
So that's one example. Or you could just say link in bio or like link is on our profile bio. 

01:01 
Like you could put any sort of text like that. All you have to do is put it up for like two or three seconds at the end of your video. 

01:08 
Doesn't even have to be text to speech. 

01:10 
Or anything just on the screen. And that's a pretty effective way to do it. 

01:14 
And you can also make it text to speech. So like make it say it out loud or even say in your voiceover as well. 

01:20 
Obviously, that's going to help even more. But it's also going to be could be a little intrusive. 

01:25 
I've always liked to keep my CTAs as subtle as possible while still being, you know, in people's eyes. 

01:32 
Right. Like people are still seeing it, but it's not overtaking the video. 

01:35 
So, yeah, this is one really subtle way to do it. 

01:39 
The next one is. 

01:40 
This is just your caption, which is another like great way people have using forever, a pretty basic this guy put store link in my insta bio, you spelt it all weird, which you don't necessarily have to do that, but you can just to be safe. 

01:55 
I'm guessing you did this before you had a thousand followers, but this is, you know, just a simple link in bio boom. 

02:01 
That's all they did. And if you think that affects your video, then explain how they got five hundred thousand likes, which is this video probably did like five to ten million views. 

02:09 
And all they did is boom link in bio and people do read captions. 

02:12 
So, like, that's that's going to do something for sure. 

02:15 
So this is probably the two simplest, like basic ways. 

02:18 
Here's a few other ways you can do it. 

02:20 
So this one's actually pretty interesting. 

02:22 
And I actually like this is putting your domain as your username. 

02:26 
So this account, they made their username get cup washer dot com. 

02:32 
So and they also put it as their like name name as well. 

02:35 
But the username is the key one, because that's what people are going to see when watching the video. 

02:39 
So like boom your domain is right in their face 

02:42 
And they're going to go search it up on their Safari if they want to. 

02:46 
And that can be a pretty effective way to do it. 

02:50 
And then another thing I want to talk about is context. 

02:52 
So this is actually a really important thing that you can do without even adding this call to action to your video. 

02:59 
And that's by simply portraying that you're selling the product. 

03:03 
So, like, boom, right here in this hook, he said, I spent. 

03:12 
So this isn't the greatest, like, video or product example, but the point of this is context. 

03:25 
So, like, he's saying I made this product. 

03:28 
So you're going to instantly know that he owns the product or he's selling the product, right, simply because the way he worded it. 

03:36 
Instead of saying, like, TikTok made me buy this or something like that where people are going to think you might just be a customer 

03:42 
When you put this sort of context in there, they instantly know you're not a customer and you're actually the one running the business and selling it. 

03:49 
So that can be a pretty powerful little hack there. 

03:52 
Lastly, which is one of the most powerful things you can do at the moment, and I actually tweeted about it, so I'm just going to show you through my tweet. 

04:01 
So say you have a video blow up and go viral, and you want to convert as many people as possible, of course. 

04:08 
So what you need to do is take advantage of your comment section. 

04:12 
Look for a comment that says, where can I get this? 

04:16 
How do I buy this? 

04:19 
Reply to it. 

04:19 
So you can see right here, he found a comment that said, where can I buy that? 

04:23 
And then he replied to it with a super salesy video. 

04:27 
So let's watch this real quick. 

04:29 
It's a great example. 

04:41 
See, super quick video, shows you exactly how to get to his website, and also shows you the website and mentions his offer as well, which is super powerful. 

04:53 
And why this is so good is because when you reply to a comment with a video on TikTok right now, TikTok will instantly put it as the top comment. 

05:03 
So everybody that looks at the comment section, first thing they see is a straight ad right to their face. 

05:08 
So this is super powerful. 

05:10 
So, but that's about it for the video. 

05:13 
Went over like five different ways to do this. 

05:14 
And this is really all you need to really convert like crazy. 

05:18 
You don't have to overthink it too much, but I hope this was helpful. 

05:22 
Got some value out of this and peace out. 

05:30 
Yo, it's good. 

05:31 
So I'm sure you guys have all heard how important CTAs, 

05:35 
also known as call to action.
