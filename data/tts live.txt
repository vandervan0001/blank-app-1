What are they? 

00:03 
TikTok shop lives are just as they sound. 

00:05 
It's where you go live on TikTok and sell a product. 

00:06 
It's where you go. 

00:08 
Similar to the Shopping Shop, your account will need TikTok Shop access to be able to do this. 

00:15 
Tutorial on how to go live. 

00:16 
It's easiest to have the product in your showcase beforehand. 

00:20 
Make sure to pin the product and add flash sales. 

00:23 
Tutorial on the next slide. 

00:28 
All right, so first, this is me just at the basic TikTok menu. 

00:33 
I'm scrolling over on the bottom right here, and I keep scrolling, and then it says live right there. 

00:40 
And then I tap product right here, and then I hit add product. 

00:50 
And this is where it shows the product in your showcase. 

00:53 
Now, if you don't have the product in your showcase, you can just hit add more product and search out the product yourself. 

00:59 
And then, okay, the video just restarted itself. 

01:03 
I have no idea why. 

01:06 
Okay, now we're back. 

01:08 
So then I add this product right here, and I just hit the back arrow, and now you can see that it is in the shop live. 

01:17 
And then I hit this billboard button right here. 

01:20 
Which brings me to this screen. 

01:28 
Now, on this screen, you can select what you want to display on the live, and you can edit it. 

01:33 
So if the product you're selling is on sale. 

01:36 
You can have them say, like, today's deal or whatever, and then edit it to fit your product sales. 

01:40 
So say you're selling something that's 20% off, you can select this one and then change 50 to 20. 

01:48 
And then you can also drag it around the screen to have it wherever you want. 

01:52 
And you can add a title to the live. 

01:54 
I just wrote the word past here. 

01:57 
And now I just simply hit go live. 

02:06 
And now the live has started. 

02:10 
I just have the screen blocked, but then you should be able to give it a second. 

02:14 
And as time progresses, you should start getting some viewers. 

02:22 
I accidentally skipped the song and didn't finish the video. 

02:27 
Yes, and the live started. 

02:31 
And then, ah, yes. 

02:33 
And then you want to hit this button right here where it says shop. 

02:39 
This is as the live is live. 

02:41 
You want to hit shop right here. 

02:45 
And then this is going to pop up, and you want to hit pin. 

02:52 
Now what this will do, you can't see it on my end, but now every time somebody enters the live, they'll see the product right here. 

02:59 
So it's automatically pinned. 

03:01 
So they don't have to tap product or anything. 

03:03 
The second they see the live, they see the product, which will help increase sales. 

03:10 
And then I also show in this clip that if you go back to the billboard tab, you can use the templates I talked about earlier. 

03:22 
Or you can hit this images tab, and you can upload images from your camera roll, which is pretty cool. 

03:34 
If you're careful. 

03:37 
Best practices for. 

03:39 
These are essentially a live take your video. 

03:42 
So you need to be entertaining as well as sell the product. 

03:46 
Good practice is to have things planned out, preplanned out to say one, I see you to live. 

03:51 
She will read over some scripts. 

03:54 
Now watch the course of video on script writing to learn how to price them. 

03:57 
9. Scripts. The scripts can be about anything from stories to testimonials. Have a few and just cycle through them, adding in some filler sentences in between each one. 

04:10 
Option. Have a second phone with the 5-star reviews of the product from TikTok shop open and scroll through sometimes and just show them as social. 

04:18 
10. Don't mention weight loss and don't respond to comments that will get you in trouble by commenting asking about weight loss. Tread lightly when mentioning the benefits. 

04:31 
11. No. TikTok shop violation rules still apply, so make sure you watch that course video as well. 

04:37 
12. Start the live as if you've been going for a while. Now what I mean by that is a lot of people struggle when they first start. 

04:45 
What do I say? Do I say welcome or whatever? 

04:48 
14. No. Just start it as if you've been going for an hour. Just think about it. If you have been going for an hour, as soon as somebody swipes to the live and joins it, it's like you're just starting it up for them. They're just joining now. 

05:01 
15. Start your live just reading off the scripts like you would do. You don't have to do anything special when you start because everyone's going to be new. Everyone that joins in, they're not going to know that it just started. They're going to think it's been going on for who knows when. 

05:12 
You continue as if you've been going for a while. 

05:16 
Mention the TikTok shop summer sale and tell people add to the cart to see the discount. 

05:21 
Now, the TikTok shop summer sale, that is a thing, but it might not apply to the product you're selling. 

05:26 
The reason you want to mention it is just basic sales tactics. 

05:30 
You know, if people think there's a sale, they're going to want to check it out. 

05:32 
So if you tell them to check out the sale and add the product you're selling to their cart, they're going to check it out. 

05:38 
Now, whether there's a crazy sale, a summer sale, or whatever season we're in, or a discount or not, 

05:45 
you just move them one step closer to checking out, which is having the product in their cart. 

05:50 
See what I'm saying? See what I'm saying? Yeah. 

05:53 
Make sure you have movement on the screen, a.k.a. don't just prop your phone up on a tripod and leave it at that. 

05:59 
Because funny enough, that can actually get you a violation point if you have too little movement on the screen. 

06:07 
Talk to the audience. 

06:09 
Ask them how their day is going. 

06:11 
Just be interactive. 

06:12 
Another fun fact. 

06:14 
If you aren't at least slightly interactive with your audience, TikTok may give you a violation point for that too. 

06:21 
That was very unlikely, but I have seen it happen. 

06:24 
Ignore and or block the haters. 

06:26 
If you're blocking them, just tap and hold on their name and hit block. 

06:30 
Turn negative comments into positive ones. 

06:33 
You know, people are saying things like, oh, this is, oh, you're scamming, oh, blah, blah, blah. 

06:38 
For example, say you're selling a supplement. 

06:39 
People are like, oh, that doesn't work. 

06:41 
Turn it into something positive. 

06:43 
Be like, hey, man, you know, I've been using this myself. 

06:47 
Just give me your personal testimonial. 

06:49 
It can be a great way to sell it. 

06:51 
You can also filter and block certain keywords. 

06:53 
So if you see people spamming a certain thing a bunch of your lives, just filter, block out those keywords, and you don't even have to deal with it. 

07:00 
If you're sitting at 15 viewers max for the first 10 minutes or so, end the live and try getting 15 minutes. 

07:07 
Or try a different count. 

07:10 
Now, that is optional. 

07:11 
Sometimes smaller lives are more effective because you can sell more than 15 lives. 

07:17 
The reason you'd want to restart this is because normally you should be getting more viewers than that pretty quickly. 

07:18 
want to restart it. 

07:22 
talk to your audience. 

07:26 
You have to, oh yeah, you have to or you'll get a violation. 

07:29 
That's what I mentioned just before. 

07:32 
And it keeps people engaged. 

07:35 
People are much more likely to stay if you're a nice person. 

07:38 
If they ask a question, you answer it. 

07:41 
If you ask them how their day's going, you know, if they ask you, you respond. 

07:45 
And sell hard. 

07:47 
If there's a sale, be urgent on the fact it's ending soon. 

07:51 
And whether there is or isn't, be aggressive with your CTA. 

07:54 
And you want people to buy what you're selling, you want them to buy it.
