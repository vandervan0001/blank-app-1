Section one, intro to talking head and Adam Manning. 

00:12 
Talking head is merely slang for exactly what it sounds like. 

00:14 
Content where you are talking and you show your face. 

00:15 
What you talk about can be anything really, 

00:17 
so long as it is entertaining and sells a product. 

00:19 
It's recommended to show your face in videos 

00:21 
I have seen success from people who have used it, 

00:23 
but honestly, saying that out loud now, 

00:24 
I'm gonna change the whole of that 

00:26 
in every video you make, you should be showing your face. 

00:28 
There's maybe like 0.5% of the time 

00:30 
there's a good reason why you don't have to. 

00:33 
how do you make it better? 

00:34 
Always show your face. 

00:35 
The videos can be any duration, just make sure you don't die. 

00:37 
Ideally, don't have them going through 

00:38 
more than two minutes of even editing. 

00:41 
Film all videos vertically, 

00:42 
not like you're filming a YouTube video. 

00:44 
Honestly, text will almost always help 

00:46 
never form two closed captions, is it? 

00:48 
Step two, or at least step two, 

00:49 
section two, breakdown of talking head. 

00:52 
The main points of making volume videos 

00:53 
are the hook, the body or story, 

00:55 
the CTA and the sound. 

00:56 
Let's break each one down. 

01:00 
For the visual, some good practices are there. 

01:01 
Have some quick initial movement for the first 2.5 seconds. 

01:04 
Have good lighting. 

01:05 
Show something visually intriguing. 

01:06 
Relate the hook to the viewer. Have high energy when you're speaking, and a quick, loud noise may help catch some attention. 

01:13 
For example, what's up, everybody? You see how my voice spiked a little bit right there? 

01:17 
You don't have to include all of these in every hook, but it's best to have at least one to two of each. 

01:21 
The vibe. You don't want to yet. Make it as concise as possible while still getting your point across. 

01:26 
Don't use filler words like, um, uh. Be entertaining and enthusiastic. 

01:31 
A strong CTA. Sell the heck out of your products. You want people to buy right there and right now. 

01:36 
Use any sales, discounts, or promotions you can get. Flex a listing sale is so good to help with sales. 

01:42 
The sound. Some videos don't need a song, so don't force yourself to. 

01:46 
For a talking head, usually no song, simple background music, or song that fits the vibe. 

01:50 
Simple background music can be a calm beat playing in the background. 

01:52 
A song that fits the vibe can be some creepy piano music if you're making a scary video. 

01:56 
For the most part, don't have songs with a lot of lyrics, because it may cause the viewer to struggle to understand what you're saying. 

02:01 
The caption. Caption should help the video out in some way. 

02:04 
Incentivizes watch time. Builds intrigue. 

02:06 
Incentivizes purchases, etc. 

02:07 
You ideally want to keep the captions short and sweet. 

02:10 
Factor three. Have a master talking head. 

02:15 
You want to become your own. 

02:17 
Look into and research the reviews of a product you sell. 

02:19 
A good place to look at reviews is Amazon. 

02:21 
If your specific product doesn't have any or many, look at ones with competitors and similar products. 

02:25 
The goal of this is to develop a deeper understanding of who you're selling to. 

02:29 
This can help you understand how they talk, then you can use that to start getting ahead of myself here. 

02:33 
This can help you understand how they talk. 

02:35 
Then you can start using their slang and language in your videos. 

02:38 
People are more likely to buy from people they can relate to and even relate to. 

02:41 
I have a course video going more in-depth on this topic, definitely check it out. 

02:45 
Killer scripts. Write out the scripts of viral videos onto your Google Doc. 

02:48 
Product compare and analyze them and see which parts of scripts seem to help the videos the 

02:52 
most and help the videos the most. Look for similarities between newsfeeds. 

02:55 
Then flank into Frankenstein newsfeeds, taking the best parts of them and making them easy to read. 

02:59 
Feel free to add some personal touches if you'd like. 

03:02 
Once you have Frankensteined a few viral scripts, start experimenting with them. 

03:06 
You'll want to look at viral scripts and break them down into parts. 

03:08 
For example, say there was a viral video where a guy was talking about his blowing job. 

03:11 
You want to break that video down into a post like this. 

03:14 
I'm going to go through this as if I'm watching a video on this guy's blowing job right now. 

03:17 
And these are the parts I'm going to break it down into. 

03:21 
Here's my crazy blowing story over the past three years. 

03:24 
I'm going to write it down. 

03:25 
And then he says, 

03:27 
And let me tell you, it's a little embarrassing. 

03:28 
Alright, that's a personal secret. 

03:30 
Sorry, I'm getting personal. 

03:31 
And then he says, 

03:32 
For starters, I don't know about you, but my stream loading baby is super insecure. 

03:36 
Talking about his insecurities? 

03:38 
And I tried so many different fixes, but none of them seem to work. 

03:40 
I honestly need to just give up. 

03:42 
Alright, he's saying he almost gave up. 

03:44 
But then, like a miracle happened. 

03:46 
I found this supplement, and it takes so much time. 

03:48 
Alright, then he said he found this product, which was his savior. 

03:50 
Alright, and after only two weeks of taking it, I have not been blowing since. 

03:55 
If you want to achieve these same results yourself, get this product linked on my TikTok shot below. 

03:59 
All right, so now I have the framework of that viral video I watched. 

04:01 
I just assumed I was watching a viral video as I wrote this down. 

04:04 
So now that I have this framework, what I can do is I can use it to create other viral videos 

04:09 
that I know have a high probability of success because this is based off a viral video. 

04:14 
So now let's create a video with this framework we just made. 

04:16 
So let's create a video about a gym transfer. 

04:21 
Here's my story of how I struggled to put on weight after working out for over two years. 

04:27 
For those of you that don't know, I've been a skinny dude my whole life, talking about insecurities. 

04:31 
And because of that, well, I felt really insecure. 

04:32 
People make fun of me because of it, and I didn't feel too good about myself, saying how I almost gave up. 

04:37 
And after two years of seeing essentially no results, I just, I didn't even want to continue anymore. 

04:43 
But then, I almost didn't need it though. 

04:44 
I was on TikTok all day, and I was like, what the fuck is weight gain? 

04:46 
You know, and after only two weeks of taking it, I gained 10,000 pounds of CTA. 

04:52 
If you're like me, and you're struggling to gain weight in the gym, try this right now. 

04:56 
Now, once again, that was just me completely freestyling off the top of my head. 

04:58 
But you see how I used this framework to live up a viral video. 

05:02 
Now, obviously, when you make these frameworks yourself, you're going to be making them all with actual viral videos. 

05:06 
And you're going to be thinking it up in your head as you go. 

05:07 
You can have a powerful tool to mitigate that. 

05:09 
This works for basically any viral video. 

05:11 
Once you have the framework, you can test and plug anything into it. 

05:15 
Don't just be in a room with subpar lighting. 

05:18 
Be cooking as you make the video. 

05:20 
Of course, it has to make sense that you're cooking. 

05:25 
This can help make the video feel more authentic as well as more meaningful. 

05:29 
The FaceTime framework. 

05:30 
Lots of people struggle to talk on the phone. 

05:31 
They don't quite have an engaging enough tone of voice to speak. 

05:33 
A good way to get past this is to act like you're on FaceTime with a friend. 

05:37 
This will make your video seem more relaxed and natural. 

05:41 
You don't like to have long screen captures. 

05:45 
Let's give this a chance to get to the point where you can create the main piece of the video. 

05:50 
This is a screenshot from a video made by yours truly. 

05:52 
Didn't I talk about literal deficiencies in the modern diet? 

05:56 
The text, we're mineral deficient, stayed up the whole video. 

06:00 
This made it so the second someone saw my video, 

06:03 
they knew it would be about mineral deficience. 

06:04 
They gave them context immediately. 

06:25 
Great video. 

06:38 
Now let's check out another example. 

06:55 
another great video this was also a tiktok trap video and converted on 

07:15 
not letting me get the fly but it converted very well 

07:18 
technical difficulty that's not letting me get the fly here i'm going to pause the 

07:23 
recording and i'll be back oh no all right silly me i apologize this was 

07:26 
actually the last slide so thank you for watching i can't skip it because 

07:29 
there's no slide after so thank you for watching the video and on to the next
