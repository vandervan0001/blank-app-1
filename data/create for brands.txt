00:06 
what is going on guys in this video so one thing you can do is work on an 

00:11 
affiliate basis working with brand so you know 300 bucks isn't that bad first 

00:19 
of all how this works you know what it is if you if you're not exactly sure so 

00:24 
there's tons there's hundreds thousands of brands that sell products online like 

00:31 
this one right here the cloudy diffuser and they are looking to expand their 

00:36 
business expand their sales using tick-tock right using these the 

00:43 
short-form content so a lot of these brand owners either don't know how to 

00:49 
make content because they're too old you know out of touch or they don't even 

00:53 
have the time to do it so what they're looking to do is hire creators right 

00:56 
just like you young people that understand tick-tock understand you know 

01:01 
the younger trends that you know everything like that I mean they'll pay 

01:06 
you anywhere from 500 bucks to 3,000 5,000 bucks a month right anywhere in 

01:12 
that range depending on your experience and like that so this is here at the 

01:17 
cloud diffuser this is one of the brands I actually work with is the account that 

01:22 
was blown up basically all we did was start posting viral content just like 

01:27 
you see here very very simple stuff and eventually it started to get traction 

01:31 
blew up it went viral and you know the account blew up we got paid a lot of 

01:35 
money for that and the crazy part is the brands like this they're not just 

01:39 
hiring one creator to run one account they're hiring tens they even sell my 

01:47 
brands hiring over a hundred creators each creator has their own separate 

01:53 
account and gets paid different like gets paid directly so each one of these 

01:58 
accounts you see here on the right is a different creator each of those creators 

02:01 
are paid anywhere from 500 to 2,000 dollars a month right so that's basically 

02:06 
how this works now let's talk about like what you kind of need to do this so one 

02:11 
you need the skill you know how to create this high quality high performing 

02:15 
content two is kind of like how to run the business side of things you know how 

02:25 
to talk with clients how to make clients keep clients happy and then three is like 

02:31 
is the obvious like how do you get clients right that's a lot of people's 

02:35 
questions so in this in this video I'm just gonna be focusing on the you know 

02:41 
becoming a creator how to make content and then in some other videos I'll go 

02:46 
over you know the business side of things and also go over how to get 

02:49 
clients those will be in to seven but when it comes to making high quality 

02:53 
content you know number one is create you know make videos every single day 

02:58 
you got to get your reps in you know even if it's just for a random product 

03:01

03:06 
you know you work with a brand that's not even paying you maybe you just order 

03:11 
a cloud user from the brand and just make content yourself but you need to be 

03:16 
making content every single day right number two study study other brands you 

03:23 
know maybe you pick a dozen brands that you you follow and you look at their 

03:27

03:30 
hooks are you know what they're doing what they're doing what they're doing 

03:31

03:35

03:42 
sections of the course like the tick tock content creation section watch all 

03:47

04:01 
make a lot of money build a little bit of a career here like you need to gain 

04:05 
some experience that's like the first thing you need to do so you know just 

04:09 
experience not only making content but working with brands so one thing you can 

04:14 
do is work on an affiliate basis working with brands just strictly on what the 

04:20

04:25 
risk free for the brand so like why wouldn't they do that or

just working on really cheap retainers right say hey I'm a beginner I want to 

04:35 
you know make content for your brand but you know I understand that I'm a 

04:41 
beginner and I'm not like super experienced at this so I'll do it for 

04:44

04:48 
you're getting paid to learn right and you're getting paid to gain experience 

04:52 
so you know 300 bucks isn't that bad because the goal is eventually you get 

04:57 
to the point where brands are paying you $1,500 per month to do your content 

05:01 
but everyone's got to start somewhere so yep that's that's basically it you know
